  <h2 class='c006'>PROLOGUE</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Terriford village, a peaceful, exquisite corner of
old England. Houses, cottages, and great raftered barns
spread over a rising stretch of what was once primeval
woodland. No dwelling-place is less than fifty years old
and many are of much older date.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the apex of the broad, well-kept village street stands
the pre-Reformation gray stone church. It rises from what
appears to be a well-tended and fragrant garden, though
here and there lichened stones and crosses show it to be
what old-fashioned folk still call a graveyard.</p>

<p class='c008'>But at the time my story opens sudden death, and all the
evils the most normal death implies in our strange, transitory
existence, seem very far from the inhabitants of Terriford.
All the more remote because the group of people who are
soon to be concerned with a mysterious and terrible drama
of death are now one and all happy, cheerful, and full of life
and excitement. For they are present as privileged spectators
at the first appearance of the great Australian cricket
team.</p>

<p class='c008'>Why, it may well be asked, should quiet Terriford village
be so honoured? It is because Harry Garlett, the man who
stands to the hamlet in the relation of squire, is the most
popular amateur cricketer in the county and the owner of
the best private cricket ground in England. Not only
money, but a wealth of loving care combined with great
technical knowledge and experience, has brought it near to
absolute perfection—this fine expanse of English turf,
framed in a garland of noble English elms and spreading
chestnut trees.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Months ago in the dreary winter, when the tour of the
Australian test match team was being arranged, Garlett
had invited the visitors to come to Terriford immediately
on landing from the boat and “play themselves in” after
the long voyage. He undertook to collect a strong team of
amateurs, stiffened with two or three professionals, that the
Australians might have something worth tackling, and he
did not fail to point out that at Terriford the visitors would
most quickly become accustomed to English pitches and the
soft English light, so different from the hard dry sunshine
and matting wickets of Australia.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett knew that the merits of his private ground
were well known over there, on the other side of the world,
but all the same he could not feel sure. And so it was one
of the happiest moments of a life which had been singularly
happy and fortunate when he received the cable informing
him that the Australian team would accept with pleasure
his kind invitation.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>To-day, on this bright spring morning, the closing day
of the great match, there could be no more characteristically
English scene than this mixture of country-house party,
garden party, and enthusiasts for the national game.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cricket is serious, but not so serious as to risk interfering
with good fellowship, the more so that this match
does not count in the tour for records and averages. The
spirit of the whole affair is one of pure good sportsmanship,
and the small group of newspaper experts whom Garlett
has invited are all eager to see how the visitors shape and
how they compare with the great Australian teams of the
past.</p>

<p class='c008'>These connoisseurs are also full of admiration for the
eleven which their host has collected. It is indeed a cleverly
composed combination. Youth is represented by some
brilliant young players from Oxford and Cambridge, cheerful
fellows who are equally likely to hit up centuries or to
make the two noughts familiarly known as “a pair of
spectacles.” But these lads are as active as monkeys in the
field and can save seemingly certain runs and bring off
seemingly impossible “catches.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then there is a sprinkling of somewhat older, but still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>young men, who have proved their mettle in the great county
teams. Last, but not least, there are three professionals—men
whose names are known wherever cricket is played and
who are past-masters in all the subtleties of the great game.</p>

<p class='c008'>Decidedly the Cornstalks, though the odds are slightly
in their favour, will have to play all out if they are to win.</p>

<p class='c008'>Any one who envied Harry Garlett his manifold good
fortune, his popularity, his good looks, his ideal life in
“Easy Street,” for he is a prosperous manufacturer as well
as a famous cricketer, might argue that were it not for the
long voyage from Australia the Garlett eleven would be
beaten to a frazzle. But the general feeling is that it is just
that handicap on the visitors which equalizes the chances
and makes the match one of real sporting interest.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pavilion is situated at the top of the cricket field
and commands a splendid view of the game. But the game
is not the only thing. Indeed, there are people there to
whom it is not only an excuse to meet, to gossip, and to
enjoy a generous host’s delightful hospitality. For, at the
back of the great room where Harry Garlett’s special guests
are all gathered together, is a buffet loaded with every kind
of delicious food, wine, and spirits. Garlett, though himself
abstemious as every keen athlete has need to be, always
offers the best of cheer to his friends, ay, and not only to
his friends, for bounteous free refreshments are also provided
for the village folk as well as for certain cricket enthusiasts
from the county town of Grendon.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now let us concentrate on a little group of people in
the pavilion, all obviously quite at ease with one another,
and all bent on making the most of a memorable occasion.
Very ordinary folk they are, typical inhabitants of almost
any English village.</p>

<p class='c008'>First, in order of precedence—the rector and his wife,
Mr. and Mrs. Cole-Wright, he kindly and far from clever,
facts which make him popular, his wife clever and not over
kindly, and therefore far less popular.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then come Dr. and Mrs. Maclean. The wise physician,
whose fame goes far beyond the confines of his practice,
has snatched a day off from his busy life in order to be
present at the closing scenes of the great match. Both
he and his wife are Scotch, but they have lived for fifteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>years very happily in this typical English village. They are
a closely united couple, and the one lack in their joint life
has lately been satisfied by their adoption of Mrs. Maclean’s
niece, Jean Bower, an attractive, cheerful-looking, happy
girl whose first introduction to the neighbourhood is taking
place to-day in Harry Garlett’s cricket pavilion. Jean is
only twenty-one, but she is not an idle girl. It is known
that she did good work during the last part of the war, and
she has lately been made secretary to the Etna China Company
of which Harry Garlett is managing director.</p>

<p class='c008'>As to the other people there, they include Colonel Brackbury,
the Governor of Grendon Prison, his sharp-featured
wife and two pretty daughters; Mr. Toogood, chief lawyer
in Grendon, with his wife and daughter; Dr. Tasker, one of
the few bachelors in the neighbourhood; and, last but not
least in that little group who are all on intimate terms with
one another, and whose affairs are constantly discussed in
secret by their humble neighbours, is Mary Prince, true
type of that peculiarly English genus unkindly called “old
maid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince is at once narrow-minded and tolerant, mean
and generous, wickedly malicious, while yet, in a sense, exceedingly
kind-hearted. Perhaps because her father was
Dr. Maclean’s predecessor the village folk consult her concerning
their ailments, grave and trifling, more often than
they do the doctor himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is one dark spot in the life of Harry Garlett. His
devoted wife, to whom as an actual fact the whole of Terriford
village belongs—or did belong till she made it over
to him—is an invalid. Many months have gone by since
she left the upper floor of the delightful Georgian manor
house, which owes its unsuitable name of the Thatched
House to the fact that it was built on the site of a medieval
thatched building.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Thatched House is a childless house, and Harry Garlett,
though on the best of terms with his invalid wife, is
constantly away, at any rate during the summer months,
playing cricket here, there, and everywhere, all over England.
So Agatha Cheale, Mrs. Garlett’s housekeeper, who is known
to be a kinswoman of her employer, plays the part of hostess
in the cricket pavilion. Even so, as the day wears on Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Cheale disappears unobtrusively two or three times in order
to see if Mrs. Garlett is comfortable and also to give her
news of the cricket match and especially news of how Mr.
Garlett is acquitting himself. Everything that concerns her
husband is of deep moment to Mrs. Garlett, and she is exceedingly
proud of his fame as a cricketer.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>On this, the second day of the great match, the Australians
have been set to make 234 runs in their second innings for
victory. When the teams go in for lunch there are few,
even among those to whom the finer shades of the game
are as a sealed book, who doubt that they will do it pretty
easily.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pitch has worn wonderfully well, and Garlett feels a
thrill of delight when he sees it roll out as true and plumb
as on the first day. He thinks with intense satisfaction of
all the patient care that he has devoted to this ground, of
all the cunning devices of drainage lying hid beneath the
level turf, and of the scientific treatment with which he has
nursed the turf up to this acme of condition. Ah, money
can do much, but money alone couldn’t have done that.
He wants to win the match, but he emphatically does not
want to owe victory to any defect of the pitch.</p>

<p class='c008'>In such happy mood does Garlett lead his team out into
the field after lunch, and the Australians start, full of confidence.
But somehow, even from the beginning, they seem
to find runs hard to get, harder than in their first
knock.</p>

<p class='c008'>The young undergraduates field like men inspired, covering
an immense lot of ground and turning what seem certain
fours into singles. Wickets fall, too. Some of the Australians
open their Herculean shoulders too soon, and, beginning
to hit before they are properly “set,” misjudge the ball and
get caught from terrific “skiers.” But still the score creeps
up. With careful generalship Garlett frequently changes
his bowling, treating the batsmen to every variety of swerve
and break that his bowlers can command.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tension grows. One of Garlett’s professionals, a
chartered jester of the Surrey team, forgets to play off the
antics with which he is wont to amuse the crowd at the
famous Oval ground, and suddenly becomes quite serious.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Still the score mounts up. On the great staging beside the
scorer’s box large tin numbers painted in white on a black
ground show the progress of the game.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, the last Australian is going in. What is the score?
Ah, see, the man is just changing the plates—yes, there
it is! Nine wickets down for 230 runs. Only four more to
make and the match is won—and lost!</p>

<p class='c008'>What is the matter? Why is Mr. Garlett talking to the
bowler? A little plan of campaign, no doubt. Every
heart on the ground beats a little faster, even surely those
well-schooled hearts concealed beneath the white flannels
which stand out so brilliantly on the deep green of the pitch.</p>

<p class='c008'>The newcomer takes his block. He is a huge creature
with thick, jet-black beard, a good man at rounding up the
most difficult steers on the far South Australian plains.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Play!” Swift flies the ball from the height of the
bowler’s swing, and our cattle tamer, playing forward, drives
it with a mighty swipe. “Oh, well hit, sir!” Is it a boundary?
If so, the match is won. No, no, one of Garlett’s
agile undergraduates has arrived like a white flash at the
right spot and at the right moment. Like lightning he
gathers the ball and returns it to the wicket. Ah, a runout?
No, yes, no—Black Beard has just got home. It was
a narrow shave, but two precious runs have been added.</p>

<p class='c008'>Only two more to make! Everyone is silent in the tense
excitement. Again the ball flies from the bowler’s hand,
and this time the Australian giant decides to go all out for
a winning hit. He opens his brawny chest, all rippling with
knotted muscles, and, taking the ball fair in the middle of
the bat, lifts it in a huge and lofty curve which seems certain
to come to earth beyond the boundary of the pitch.</p>

<p class='c008'>But wait! Garlett is there, at extra long-on. It is the
catch he has planned with the bowler. It is all over in a
moment, and yet what a long moment it seems to the entranced
spectators!</p>

<p class='c008'>That little round leather ball high up against the evening
sky reaches the top of its flight. Ah, it is over the pavilion!
No, it is impossible! But Garlett does it, all the same.
With a mighty backward leap he gets the ball into his safe
hands just as it was dropping on to the seats in front of the
pavilion.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Out! Our cattle tamer is out, the last Australian wicket,
and the match is won—by one run!</p>

<p class='c008'>Every one feels the curious tingling thrill that comes
of having seen a feat that will become historic. Garlett’s
great catch that won the Australian match for his eleven
will be talked about and written about for years to come,
wherever cricket is had in honour.</p>

<p class='c008'>Garlett has picked himself up from where he fell after his
terrific leap—but still, you may be sure, holding the precious
ball safely to his chest—and instantly he is the centre of a
throng of cheering and congratulatory friends, among whom
the Cornstalks themselves are foremost.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>In the star-powdered sky there hung a pale, golden moon.
It was the 25th of May, and though the day had been
warm and sunny, it was cold to-night, and even as early as
ten o’clock most of the lights were extinguished in Terriford
village.</p>

<p class='c008'>But “the moon is the lovers’ sun”: such was the conceit
which a tall, loosely built man had just propounded to the
girl walking by his side on the field path which lay like a
white ribbon across the four cornfields stretching between
the Thatched House Farm and the well-kept demesne of
the Thatched House.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl—Lucy Warren was her name, and she was parlour-maid
at the Thatched House—made no answer. She
could well have spared the moonlight. She knew that not
only her clever, capable mother, but also all the gossips who
made up her little world, would be shocked indeed did they
see her walking, in this slow, familiar, loverlike way, with
her mother’s lodger, Guy Cheale.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not that shrewd Mrs. Warren disliked her lodger. In
spite of herself she had become very fond of him. He was
such a queer, fantastic—had she known the word, she might
have added cynical—young gentleman.</p>

<p class='c008'>But though she liked him, and though his funny talk
amused her, Mrs. Warren would have been wroth indeed
had she known of the friendship between her lodger and
her daughter. And the mother would have been right to
feel wroth, for, while doing everything to make Lucy love
him with that fresh, wonderful young love that only comes
to a woman once, Guy Cheale never spoke to Lucy of marriage.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the matter of that, how could he speak of marriage,
being that melancholy thing, a penniless gentleman? A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>man whose lodging at the farm even was paid for by his
sister, herself companion-housekeeper at the Thatched
House. There were a dozen newspapers in London which
would always print everything Guy Cheale chose to write,
but he liked talking better than writing, and he was in very
poor health.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lucy hated to think that the man whom deep in her
heart she had come passionately to love was too lazy—or
was it really too ill?—to make a living. She disliked her
lover’s sister, Agatha Cheale, with a deep, instinctive, fierce
dislike, and sometimes she smiled, though it was not a happy
smile, at the thought of how angry Miss Cheale would be if
she knew that Mr. Cheale and she, Lucy, were lovers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not quite so quick, my pretty Lucy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Guy Cheale was panting painfully—and a rush of that
pity which is akin to love filled Lucy Warren’s heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I mustn’t be late,” she said nervously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re not late, Lucy”—he held up his watch close to
his eyes. “It’s only twenty to ten,” and then he added,
in that voice which he knew how to make at once so strangely
tender, persuasive, and yes—mocking, “Let’s go into our
enchanted wood for five minutes, as you won’t let me in to
that drawing room of yours.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It ain’t my drawing room, as you knows full well. If
it was, you’d be welcome to come into it,” she exclaimed
resentfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>He guided her down the path leading to the wood, and
then, once they were under the shelter of the trees, he
clutched her to him with a strength which at once frightened
and comforted her—for it seemed to prove that he could not
be as ill as he was made out to be.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Love and life,” he muttered, “the one’s no good without
the other!” He bent his head and their lips clung together
in a long long kiss.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Guy Cheale was filled with a delicious sense
of triumph and of exultation. He had won this proud sensitive
creature at last—after a long, to him a breathless,
exciting chase.</p>

<p class='c008'>But all at once he felt her stiffen in his arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush!” she whispered. “There’s some one in the
wood!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>He did not relax his almost terrible grip of her, as he
too, listened intently.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lucy was right; he could hear the light, stuffless sound
of footsteps sinking into the dead leaves which still, on this
spring night, lay thickly spread on the path.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only happy lovers like you and me,” he whispered huskily.
“They’re not troubling about us—why trouble about
them?”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the girl was frightened. “For God’s sake, go away,
Mr. Cheale!” she pleaded in a terrified whisper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One kiss more, Lucy. Only one kiss more——”</p>

<p class='c008'>But she lay inertly in his arms, all her senses absorbed
in listening. How different from only fifty seconds ago!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lucy,” he whispered, “Lucy? We can’t part like this,
to-night—the first time my goddess has yielded me her
lips.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Though full of nervous terror, she was moved by the real
feeling in his voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll go and see who it is,” she muttered in his ear. “You
stop where you are.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Promise to come back!”</p>

<p class='c008'>For only answer she took up his thin right hand and laid
it against her cheek; and then she crept quickly away, moving
almost soundlessly along, for she knew every turn of
the little wood.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last she came back, panting a little.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who was it?” he whispered eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know. They’re gone now. But I’ve not a minute
left.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He could hear by her voice that she was anxious, preoccupied,
and with the strange, dangerous power he possessed
of seeing into a woman’s mind he knew that she had
not told the truth—that she was well aware of the identity
of those other haunters of the enchanted wood. But he had
no wish to share her knowledge. The good folk of Terriford,
who meant so much to Lucy Warren, meant less than
nothing to Guy Cheale.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You and that tiresome old cook go up to bed as soon
as you come in, don’t you?” he asked suddenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, we do,” she replied hesitatingly, knowing well, as she
would have expressed it to herself, what he was after.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“If I give you twenty minutes,” he whispered caressingly,
“it will be quite safe for you to let me into the drawing
room, eh—little hawk?”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was his supreme term of endearment—and once more
she allowed him to take her into his arms, and press her with
an almost terrible strength to his breast. But——</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s wrong,” she whispered, “it’s wrong, Mr. Cheale. I
ought never to have let you into the drawing room. ’Tain’t
mine to use that way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s why I like our doing it!” he chuckled.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then with that queer touch of malicious triumph that
fascinated her, he added: “What would sister Agatha say
if walls could speak?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you go saying that! Miss Cheale’s never in the
drawing room,” she exclaimed, affrighted at the very
thought. “No one ever is—now that the mistress keeps upstairs.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No one but you and me, Psyche!” and then he took her
face between his hands and lightly kissed it. “I won’t stay
long to-night, I promise—but we can’t meet to-morrow,
worse luck! Your uncle’s spending the night at the farm.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t see what you fancy about Uncle Enoch——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I like lawyers—they’re such rascals! Why he was telling
your mother all about Mrs. Garlett’s will last Sunday——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He never was?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lucy felt very much shocked. Even she knew that in
doing such a thing her uncle, Enoch Bent, confidential clerk
to Mr. Toogood, the leading lawyer of Grendon, was acting
in a very dishonourable manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Run along now,” exclaimed Guy Cheale, a touch of
rasped impatience in his voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then he seized her again in his arms—only to push
her away. “I’ll wait till we can kiss at ease—in the drawing
room! Strange that hideous, early Victorian temple of
respectability should shelter the love of two wild hawks like
you and me—eh, Lucy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then she left him and hurried through the wood,
uncaring now of the sounds her light footsteps made. She
knew she was late—it must be quite a bit after ten o’clock.
But cookie was a kindly, good-natured, elderly woman, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>didn’t mind waiting up for a little while. But once, when
Lucy had been half an hour late, Miss Cheale had caught her,
and spoken to her very severely.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>A quarter of an hour later Lucy, after tiptoeing down
the silent house, opened the drawing-room door, and, after
closing it with infinite precaution, passed through into the
dark room. Then she turned and locked the door behind
her.</p>

<p class='c008'>The white dimity covers of the heavy, early Victorian
furniture by which Mrs. Garlett, the invalid sleeping just
above the drawing room, set such store, made luminous
patches in the big L-shaped apartment, and somehow added
to Lucy Warren’s feeling of nervous unease.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though the passionate, newly awakened side of her beating
heart was burning to hear the tiny tap on the long French
window which she knew would herald Guy Cheale’s approach,
there was another side of the girl which hated and
was deeply ashamed of allowing a meeting with her lover
here.</p>

<p class='c008'>She felt that whom she saw, and even what she did, when
out of doors, under the sky, was no one’s business but her
own—and perhaps, in a much lesser measure, her mother’s.
She would also have felt differently had she and Guy Cheale
been able to meet alone in the servants’ hall of the Thatched
House. But the drawing room she felt to be ground sacred
to Mrs. Garlett, so dear and precious indeed to the mistress
of the Thatched House that it was never used now, not even
on the rare occasions when Harry Garlett had a friend to
dinner. Guy Cheale, however, had discovered that the
drawing room, alone of all the ground-floor rooms of the
spacious old house, had a French window opening into the
garden, and he and Lucy Warren had already met there
twice.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Lucy stood in the dark room, listening intently, her
nerves taut, her heart beating, there suddenly swept over
her an awful prevision of evil, a sudden realization of her
folly in allowing Guy Cheale to wile her heart away. She
knew, alas! that he was spoiling her for the only life open
to such as she—the life of an honest, commonplace, working
man’s wife.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>She remembered to-night with an almost anguished vividness
the first time she had ever seen Guy Cheale—last February,
on her first “afternoon off” in the month. She had
gone home to the Thatched House Farm to help her mother
with the new gentleman lodger, and, being a girl of a proud
independent nature, she had come prepared to dislike him,
the more so that she hated his sister, Mrs. Garlett’s strict,
sarcastic young lady housekeeper. And then she had opened
the door of the little farmhouse parlour, and seen the big,
loosely built fair man who was to be “her fate.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His keen, thin, large-boned face, alive with a kind of
gay, plucky humour, large heavy-lidded gray eyes, and long,
loose-limbed figure, were each and all so utterly unlike Miss
Cheale that no one could have believed them to be what
they were, brother and sister.</p>

<p class='c008'>Guy Cheale had often reverted to the enchanted moment
that had brought them first face to face; and he had told
her again and again what she was never tired of hearing—how
beautiful, how proud and how disdainful he had thought
her.</p>

<p class='c008'>But she knew nothing of the cruel hunting instinct which
had prompted what had immediately followed her entry
into the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is your name?” he had asked, and when she answered,
“Lucy, sir. I’m Mrs. Warren’s daughter,” he had
got up and, gazing straight into her face, had uttered the
strange, poignant words—“A dying man—for that’s what
I’m supposed to be, my pretty dear—ought to be given a
certain license, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“License, sir?” she had repeated, falteringly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“License in the way of love-making! I suppose you
know, Lucy, that I’m said to be dying? And so I am—dying
for a little love!”</p>

<p class='c008'>That had been the beginning of it all. And though she
had been, for quite a long while, what she termed to herself
“standoffish,” they had become, in time, dear friends—meeting
often in secret, as some dear friends are forced to do.
It had not been easy for them to meet, even in secret; for
there is no place in the world so full of a kind of shrewd,
cruel scandal-mongering as is an English village, and it said
much for the intelligence, not only of Guy Cheale, but also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>of Lucy Warren, that their names had never yet been connected
the one with the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the same, as is always the way with a man and a
woman who are determined on meeting, they had seen each
other almost daily. And now and again they had had a
grand, a wonderful innings! Once Mrs. Warren had had
to go away for a week and Lucy had been given some hours
off each day in order that she might prepare the lunch and
supper of her mother’s lodger.</p>

<p class='c008'>During those days—days on which he had insisted on
helping her to do everything, even to the cooking of his meals
in the big, comfortable farm kitchen, their friendship had
grown apace. No man knew better the way to a woman’s
heart, and, posing then as her friend, and only as her friend,
he had encouraged her to talk about everything and everybody
that interested her—her employer, Harry Garlett, the
famous county cricketer, his sickly wife, and even the country
village gossip.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even so, in defence of her heart, Lucy Warren had put
up a good fight—a fight which, as the time went on, stimulated,
excited, sometimes even maddened Guy Cheale. He
found, with surprise and even discomfiture, that what he
had begun in idle and ignoble sport, was becoming to him a
matter of interest, even of importance.</p>

<p class='c008'>This, perhaps, was why now, while Lucy Warren stood
in the dark drawing room, her mind filled with tense, questioning
memories, Guy Cheale, padding up and down the
lawn like some huge, loose-limbed creature of the woods,
was also asking himself intimate, searching questions.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was already ruefully aware that this would probably
be one of the last times that he and this poor girl whom
he had forced to love him would meet, and it irked him to
know how much he would miss her from out his strange,
sinister life—the life which he knew was ebbing slowly but
surely to a close. He had made love to many, many women,
but this was the first time he had been thrown into close
intimacy with a country girl of Lucy’s class—that sturdy,
self-respecting British yeoman class which has been for
generations the backbone of the old country.</p>

<p class='c008'>Very soon—how soon to a day not even Guy Cheale could
tell—he would have left the Thatched Farm. And oh! how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>he would like to take Lucy with him, even for a little while.
But, bad as he was, there was yet in him still a small leaven
of good which forced him to admit that he owed Lucy Warren
something for the love which, if passionate, was so pure
and selfless. Sometimes, when he felt more ailing than
usual, he would tell himself that when within sight of that
mysterious bourne from which no traveller returns he would
send for Lucy, marry her, and be nursed by her to the end.</p>

<p class='c008'>But now, on this warm May night, he put painful thoughts
away, and determined to extract the greatest possible enjoyment
from what could only be, alas! the fleeting present.</p>

<p class='c008'>Treading over the grass as lightly as might be, he leaped
across the narrow gravel footpath which ran round the front
of the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then a most untoward thing happened! Unaware
that Lucy had unlatched the hasp of the long French window,
Guy Cheale leaned against it, panting, and fell forward into
the room—his heavy boot crashing through one of the lower
panes.</p>

<p class='c008'>He uttered a stifled oath, then stood up and, walking forward,
felt in the darkness for the terror-stricken girl. For
a few minutes they stood together listening intently; then,
reassured, he led her over to a couch and, throwing himself
down on it, he clasped her to him closely.</p>

<p class='c008'>His arms were round her, he was kissing her eagerly,
thirstily, when all at once she gave a stifled cry—she had
heard the handle turn in the locked door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I expect it’s Miss Cheale,” she whispered. “She taxed
me the other night with having a sweetheart I was ashamed
of! Go away—quick! She’ll get round to the window in
a minute——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Guy Cheale leaped up and rushed across the room. Desperately
he tried to find the awkward, old-fashioned catch,
and just as the second door of the drawing room—a door the
existence of which Lucy had forgotten—was unlatched, and
the electric light switched on, he flung open the window and
disappeared into the dark garden.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the figure which advanced slowly into the L-shaped
room was not that of Agatha Cheale. Lucy, petrified with
shame and fear, knew it for that of the invalid mistress of
the Thatched House.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Clad in an old-fashioned white dressing gown, her pallid
face filled with mingled curiosity and fright, Mrs. Garlett
looked like a wraith, and far more willingly would the girl,
who stood before her with hanging head, have faced a real
spirit.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a long, breathless moment Mrs. Garlett, dazzled by
the light, peered round her, looking this way and that. Then,
“Lucy!” she exclaimed, in a tone of keen surprise and anger,
and again, “Lucy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Turning slowly round, she called out to some one who
apparently had remained in the passage outside.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can come in now, Miss Cheale. I was right and
you were wrong. I <i>did</i> hear a noise upstairs—after all,
my bedroom’s just over here. It was Lucy Warren—in here
with a man. He has just escaped through the window.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Miss Cheale, the woman whom Lucy Warren
hated, feared and, yes, despised, came into the room. She
gave one swift glance of contempt and reprobation at the
unhappy culprit, glanced at the open French window, and,
turning to her employer, exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will see Lucy to-morrow morning, Mrs. Garlett.
Please come up to bed at once. You’ve done a very dangerous
thing in coming down like this!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The invalid lady allowed herself to be led, unresisting,
away; and then, mechanically, Lucy went over to the window
and stared out, her bosom heaving with sobs, and tears
streaming from her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>But no kindly, mocking, caressing whisper came to comfort
and reassure her out of the darkness. By this time
Guy Cheale must be well on his way back to the farm.</p>

<p class='c008'>Turning slowly, she threaded her way through the white-shrouded
furniture, unlocked the door nearest to her, and
walked out, forgetting or uncaring that the electric light
which had been turned on by Mrs. Garlett by the other door
was still burning.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>It was twelve o’clock the next morning, and the sun was
streaming into the pleasant downstairs rooms of the
Thatched House. The only sign of last night’s alarums and
excursions was the broken window in the drawing room,
and of that no one but the three closely concerned were
aware, for early in the morning Miss Cheale had crept downstairs,
put out the electric light, and locked both the doors.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Mrs. Garlett had been thoroughly upset by what had
happened in the night, and Miss Cheale had thought it well
to telephone for the doctor.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>“No good to herself—and no good to anybody else, poor
soul!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean was uttering his thoughts aloud, as even the
most discreet of physicians will sometimes do when with an
intimate acquaintance. He was speaking of his patient,
Mrs. Garlett, and addressing Agatha Cheale.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were people in Grendon who envied Agatha Cheale
her position as practical mistress of the charming old house.
She was known to be distantly related to its master, Harry
Garlett, and that made her position there less that of a dependent
than it might have been. No one else used the
pretty little sitting room where she and the doctor were now
standing. But Dr. Maclean—shrewd Scot that he was—knew
that Agatha Cheale was not to be envied, and that her
job was both a difficult and a thankless one.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he uttered his thoughts aloud, his kindly eyes became
focussed on the woman before him. She was slight and
dark, her abundant, wavy hair cut almost as short as a boy’s.
This morning the intensely bright eyes which were the most
arresting feature of her face, and the only one she had in
common with her fair-haired brother, had dark pouches
under them.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Dr. Maclean told himself that she had made a mistake
in giving up the busy, useful, interesting life of secretary to
the boss of a London trading company.</p>

<p class='c008'>He asked suddenly: “When are you going to have your
holiday?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know that I shall take a holiday.” She looked
at him with a touch of tragic intensity. “I’m all right, really—though
I don’t sleep as well as I might.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be angry with me for asking you a straight question.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A wave of colour flooded her pale face. “I won’t promise
to answer it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why do you go on with this thankless job?” he said
earnestly. “Within a week or two at most I could find a
competent nurse who could manage Mrs. Garlett. Why
should <i>you</i> waste your life over that cantankerous, disagreeable
woman?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Agatha Cheale said something which very much
surprised Dr. Maclean.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am thinking of giving up the job in September. That’s
the real reason why I’m not going to take a holiday now.
You see,” she hesitated perceptibly, “I’m afraid it will terribly
upset Cousin Harry—my leaving here, I mean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course it will upset him. Thanks to you, he can go
off on his cricketing jaunts with a light heart. Master
Harry’s a man to be envied——”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned and faced him. “With a wife like that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He married her, after all!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why did he marry her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean hesitated a moment. Then he answered
frankly: “Harry Garlett married Emily Jones because he
was a simple, good-looking lad aged twenty-two, and she a
clever, determined woman aged twenty-seven who was in
love with him. Old Jones was a queer, suspicious creature—the
Etna China Company was a one-man concern in his
day. A business friend asked old Jones to give a young man
in whom he was interested a job; and there came along that
cheery young chap.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’ve been married thirteen years to-day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“God bless my soul—so they have!” exclaimed Dr. Maclean.
“But the war took a great chunk out of that, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Garlett joined up at once. I remember how surprised we
all were. Somehow it didn’t seem necessary then—not for
a man with a stake in the world. But he was mad to go,
and he was in France early in ’fifteen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She says it was then that she fell ill.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She was always ailing—she’s a thoroughly unhealthy
woman,” Dr. Maclean spoke with abrupt decision. “I was
looking at Dr. Prince’s casebook the other day, and I came
across her entry. She was an unhealthy child and an unhealthy
girl—far too fussy about herself always. Well
I remember her bringing me the War Office telegram
with the news of that awful wound of Garlett’s. But she
wouldn’t go to France, not she! Yet—” he hesitated—“in
her own queer way she’s absolutely devoted to him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Agatha Cheale said in a low voice, “None of us thought
he could get over that wound.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, of course!” the doctor exclaimed. “You were
there, Miss Cheale, in that French war hospital. But I
suppose you’d known Harry Garlett long before then—as
you’re his cousin?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at her rather hard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d never met Cousin Harry till we met in that strange
way in France,” she answered composedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He told me once that he owed his life to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That, of course, is nonsense,” she said in a hard tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He has plenty to be grateful to you for <i>now</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Agatha Cheale’s usually pale face became suffused with
dusky red. It was an overwhelming, an unbecoming blush,
and, with a quickening of the pulse, Dr. Maclean told himself
that this involuntary betrayal of deep feeling answered a
question which he had half ashamedly often asked himself
in the last year—was Agatha Cheale secretly attached to
Harry Garlett? Was that the real reason she was spending
her life, her intelligence, her undoubted cleverness, in looking
after his sickly, tiresome wife?</p>

<p class='c008'>Doctors know of many hidden tragedies, of many secret
dramas in being, and this particular doctor knew more than
most, for he had a very kindly heart. He felt glad that
Mrs. Garlett’s companion was leaving the Thatched House,
though her doing so would throw a good deal of trouble on
him.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>After he had gone, Agatha Cheale went over to the window.
There she pressed her forehead against the glass, and
her eyes filled with bitter tears. For perhaps the thousandth
time in the last few months she told herself that she would
leave the Thatched House, forget Mrs. Garlett and her tiresome
exactions, and, above all, forget Harry Garlett.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett? She did not require to shut her eyes to
visualize the tall, still young-looking man whom the sick
woman upstairs called husband. Every feature, every distinctive
line about his good-looking, oftener merry than sad,
alert expression of face, was printed on the tablets of
Agatha’s tormented, unhappy heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>Why was it that she, a proud woman, and, until she had
met Harry Garlett, a cold woman, cared as she had come to
care for this man? Garlett was not nearly as clever as
many of the men with whom her work had brought her in
contact during the war and since. The great surgeon whose
favourite nurse she had become in the oddly managed, private
war hospital, where all the square pegs had been forced
into round holes, had shown her unmistakably that he was
violently attracted by her dark, aloof beauty, but, far from
being pleased, she had been bitterly distressed at what she
had regarded as an insult.</p>

<p class='c008'>Memories crowded thick upon her. She remembered cutting
the bloodstained uniform off an unconscious form, and
her thrill of surprise when she had read on his disc the most
unusual name of Garlett—the second name by which she,
herself, had been christened—she had never been able to
discover why.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was true, she had saved, not his life, but his bowling
arm. And oh, how grateful he had been—then! At once
they had fallen into the way, at first in joke, of calling each
other “Cousin Harry” and “Cousin Agatha.” But there
had been no love passages between them. He had at once
told her that he was a married man, and very soon, also, she
had come to understand that he was not “that sort.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The war had been over some months when one day, by
one of those chances which often deflect the whole of a human
existence, they had run up against one another in a
London street. She had asked him to come back to the
modest rooms she occupied in Bloomsbury, and it was there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>that he had told her his wife was now a complete invalid,
that she refused to have a nurse, and that it was difficult to
get even a lady housekeeper who would satisfy her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Would you like me to try and find you some one?” she
had asked. Eagerly he had caught at the suggestion, and
that same night she had written and offered to come herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>There had then taken place another interview between herself
and the man who held for her so strong an attraction
and appeal. It had been a rather emotional interview.
Harry Garlett, filled with gratitude, had insisted that she
should have a really large, some would have said an extravagant,
salary, and she had revealed the existence of the
clever, idle, sickly brother who was the ever-present burden
and anxiety of her life.</p>

<p class='c008'>It had been her suggestion that the people in the neighbourhood
should be told that she and her employer were
related. Her name was Agatha Garlett Cheale, after all.
Surprised, he had yielded, reddening as he did so under his
tan.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I daresay you’re right! They’re a gossiping set of
women in my part of the world.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not more so than in other places,” and something had
made her add: “They gossiped about us in the hospital, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did they? I didn’t know that!” And he had looked
amused—only amused.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her first sight of Mrs. Garlett—how well she remembered
it! “Poor Emily” had not been very gracious, though in
time she had thawed. The sick woman realized the difference
cool, competent Agatha Cheale made to the Thatched
House, and to herself Mrs. Garlett grudgingly admitted that
Miss Cheale’s sense and discretion matched her more useful
qualities.</p>

<p class='c008'>To those ladies who were kind enough to call on her—and
practically every lady in the neighbourhood considered it her
duty to make acquaintance with Harry Garlett’s cousin—Agatha
explained that she never went out in the evening.
So the delicate question as to whether she was or was not to
be asked out to dinner with her employer was solved once
for all, in the way every hostess had hoped it would be.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>As Dr. Maclean walked quickly down the short avenue
which led from the Thatched House to the carriage gate
his mind was full of the woman he had just left.</p>

<p class='c008'>He did not like Agatha Cheale, yet he did feel intensely
sorry for her. For one thing she must be so lonely at times,
for, with one exception, she had made no friends in either
Terriford or Grendon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The one person of whom she saw a good deal was clever,
malicious Miss Prince. People had wondered more than
once at the link between Miss Prince and Agatha Cheale,
but there was nothing mysterious about it. Though Miss
Prince was acquainted with every man, woman, and child
in Terriford she led a somewhat solitary life in the Thatched
Cottage, a pleasant little house which formed a kind of enclave
in the Thatched House property. Thus propinquity
had something to do with the friendship between the younger
and the older woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was one great difference, however, between them.
Miss Prince was what some people call “churchy,” while
Agatha Cheale never went to church at all, and on one occasion
she had spoken to Dr. Maclean with a slightly contemptuous
amusement of those who did.</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor was close to the wrought-iron gate giving into
the road which led to his own house when, suddenly, he espied
this very lady, Miss Prince, coming toward him. She
held a basket in her hand, and he did not need to be told that
it contained some dainty intended for Mrs. Garlett. Like
so many sharp-tongued mortals, Miss Prince often did kind
things, yet her opening remark was characteristic of her
censorious attitude to her fellow creatures.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a good thing that Harry Garlett’s rather more at
his factory just now. If it weren’t for poor old Dodson,
that Etna China business would have gone to pieces long
ago! I never saw a man gad about as he does——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Without giving the doctor time to answer, she went on:
“No change in poor Emily, I suppose?” She smiled disagreeably.
“I expect you’d like to have ten other patients
like her, Dr. Maclean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>At once he carried the war into the enemy’s country.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did Dr. Prince like that type of tiresome, cantankerous,
impossible-to-please patient?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“I know I was glad of them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well for you who had the spending of the fees
and none of the work!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They generally sparred like this, jokingly in a sense, but
with a sort of unpleasant edge to their banter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t suppose Emily will ever get better—till she dies
of old age,” laughed Miss Prince.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As a matter of fact, she’s markedly less well than she
was last year.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean didn’t know what provoked him to say that,
though it was true that he had thought Mrs. Garlett rather
less well than usual these last few weeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s strange that everything in nature, having performed
its work, dies, and that only we poor human beings linger
on long after any usefulness we ever had in the world has
gone,” said Miss Prince musingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t believe that Mrs. Garlett was ever useful,” he
said curtly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, she was! In her queer way Emily was a very
devoted daughter to that horrid old father of hers. And
she’s made Harry Garlett.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again the spirit of contradiction seized him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know what you mean,” he exclaimed. “Harry
Garlett’s the sort of chap who’d have got on far better as a
bachelor than as a married man. His wife’s money has
ruined him—that’s my view of it! There’s a lot more in
Garlett than people think. If he hadn’t married that poor,
sickly woman he might have done some real work in the
world.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dr. Maclean,” said Miss Prince abruptly, “I’m anxious
about Agatha Cheale.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So am I, Miss Prince.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He lowered his voice, for he didn’t want some stray
gardener’s boy to overhear what he was about to say.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re her only friend hereabouts,” he went on. “Do
you know that she’s thinking of giving up her job? Mind
you keep her up to that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She gave him a curious look.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’ll never go—as long as Harry Garlett’s here,” she
said, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you think Garlett will ask her to stay?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>“No, I don’t. I think he’s longing for her to go.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was taken aback. “Why d’you think that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘He who will not when he may, when he will he shall
have nay.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean stared at Miss Prince distrustfully. What
exactly did she mean by that enigmatic quotation?</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re not a fool!” she said tartly. “Harry Garlett’s
not the first man who’s made love to a woman—and then
been sorry he had, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You think there was a time when Garlett made love to
Miss Cheale?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean’s voice also fell almost to a whisper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sure of it! She’s never admitted it, mind you—don’t
run away with that idea.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t believe Harry Garlett has ever made love to
Agatha Cheale,” said the doctor, definitely making up his
mind. “I think he’s an out-and-out white man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince smiled a wry smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m positive that something happened lately which
changed their relations to one another. Harry’s afraid of
her—he avoids her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve never noticed anything of the kind,” said the other
brusquely.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince looked vexed; no gossip likes to be contradicted,
and she proceeded to pay the doctor out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your niece seems to be giving great satisfaction at the
Etna factory,” she observed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think she is—I hope she is! Jean’s a good conscientious
girl.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And so attractive, too! Every one was saying how
pretty she looked at the cricket match. Times are changed
since we were young, Dr. Maclean. What would my father
have said if I’d insisted on being boxed up hour after hour
with an old bachelor like Mr. Dodson—or an attractive
young married man like Harry Garlett?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor felt annoyed. What a spiteful woman Miss
Prince was, to be sure!</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think she runs any risk with either of them.”
He tried to speak jokingly, but failed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How about them?” she asked meaningly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps she’ll become Mrs. Dodson,” he answered dryly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>But as Mr. Dodson was sixty-four and Jean Bower twenty-one,
that didn’t seem very likely.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lifting his hat, Dr. Maclean walked briskly on his way,
telling himself that Miss Prince, like most clever people,
was an extraordinary bundle of contradictions—kind, spiteful,
generous, suspicious, affectionate and hard-hearted, and
a mischief-maker all the time!</p>

<p class='c008'>The subject of his thoughts hurried on toward the
Thatched House. She was precise in all her ways, and she
wanted to leave her little gift for Mrs. Garlett, enjoy a short
talk with Agatha Cheale, and then get back to her midday
meal by one o’clock.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll see Miss Cheale just for a minute,” she said to the
maid—not Lucy Warren—who opened the door. “I suppose
she’s in her sitting room?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Without waiting for an answer Miss Prince went off, with
her quick, decided step, through into the house she knew so
well.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the door opened, Agatha Cheale turned round quickly,
filled with a sudden, unreasonable hope that it might be
Harry Garlett. He had gone to the china factory this morning,
though it was Saturday, and he had telephoned that he
would be back to luncheon.</p>

<p class='c008'>But she reminded herself bitterly that he never sought her
out now. If he had anything to communicate to her connected
with the running of the house, he always made a
point of doing so at one of the rare meals they took together,
in the presence of the parlour-maid, Lucy Warren.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve brought a few forced strawberries for poor Emily,”
began Miss Prince, and then, lowering her voice perceptibly,
she added: “I understand she’s not so well as usual?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The other looked at her surprised.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see no change,” she said indifferently.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Miss Prince became aware that the younger
woman had been crying.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, Agatha,” she spoke with kindly authority.
“It’s time you had a change! You’re badly in need of a
holiday. It’s all very well for Harry Garlett—his life’s a
perpetual holiday.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s been working much harder than usual lately,” the
other said quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>There came a gleam into Miss Prince’s eye.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think there may be a reason for that,” she said rather
mysteriously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Any special reason?” asked Agatha Cheale indifferently.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince hesitated. This morning, at early celebration,
she had resolved that she would make a real effort to
cure herself of what she knew in her heart was her one outstanding
fault—to herself she called it, quite rightly, sin—that
of retailing malicious tittle-tattle. But somehow she
felt strongly tempted to say just one word, and, as so often
happens with those cursed with her peculiar temperament,
she was half persuaded that in saying what she now determined
to say she would be doing the right thing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course you know that Jean Bower, Mrs. Maclean’s
niece, has become secretary to the Etna China Company?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I didn’t know it.” Agatha Cheale was more surprised
than she chose to show.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How very odd of them not to have told you! I mean,
how odd of Harry, and how odd of Dr. Maclean. Why,
she’s been at the Etna factory for quite a month.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought the girl was well off.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“When her father died it was found that he had only left
fifteen hundred pounds. And though the Macleans have
practically adopted her, she seems to have said she would
much prefer to do some work than to be just idle; so Mrs.
Maclean, hearing that a secretary was wanted at the Etna
factory, managed to catch Harry Garlett at the office one day
and asked if he would give Jean a trial. Of course he had
to say ‘yes.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose he had,” said Agatha Cheale slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean Bower’s attractive, youthful personality had been
impressed on her in the cricket pavilion during the great
Australian match. She had envied the girl, not only her
bright artless charm of manner, but also the warm affection
the doctor and his wife had shown her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hear old Dodson is quite bewitched by her, and that
even Harry himself is at the factory a great deal more than
he used to be,” went on Miss Prince.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That isn’t true about Cousin Harry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Agatha Cheale forced herself to smile, but in her heart
she knew that Harry Garlett had gone to the factory oftener
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>this last month than he had ever done since she first came
to Terriford. As for old Dodson, he was just the kind of
foolish old bachelor to be bewitched by a young girl. After
being head clerk for a number of years, he had been made a
partner, and now practically ran the prosperous business.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince looked sharply at her friend.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, just now you said he had been working hard
lately?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t mean at the factory.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s all very well to be unconventional,” went on Miss
Prince, “but human nature doesn’t alter. For my part I
think it’s a mistake to mix up attractive girls with married
men.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Dodson isn’t a married man,” observed Agatha
Cheale.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, but Harry Garlett is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The other made no answer, and Miss Prince suddenly exclaimed
triumphantly, “Why, there they are!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Agatha Cheale turned quickly round.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yes, Miss Prince was right. Through the window could
be seen two figures walking slowly across the meadow, to
the right of which stretched the little wood.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should have thought that Harry would have had more
sense! I don’t wonder they’re already beginning to be
talked about,” observed Miss Prince.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a lot of disgusting people there are in Grendon,”
said Agatha Cheale. There was a note of bitter scorn in her
voice. “It’s Saturday to-day. That’s why they’re walking
back together. It’s the first time they’ve done it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince would have been not only surprised but deeply
shocked had she been able to see into her friend’s unhappy
heart. Agatha Cheale, gazing out on those two who were
just coming through the little gate which led from the cornfield
into the garden of the Thatched House, had felt a
surge of intolerable suspicion and jealousy sweep over her,
and that though her reason told her that the suspicion, at
any rate, was utterly uncalled-for and absurd.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince looked at her wrist watch—one of her few
concessions to modern ways.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must be going,” she exclaimed; “it’s almost one
o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>She had only just left the room when there came a knock
at the door. “Come in!” called out Miss Cheale, and Lucy
Warren appeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You said you wanted to see me before lunch, miss.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Though the girl was making a great effort to seem calm,
her lips were trembling and her eyes were swollen with
crying.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Late that same evening, Dr. Maclean, his wife, and their
adopted daughter, were all sitting together in the
dining room of Bonnie Doon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Macleans had bought the charming old house soon
after the doctor had taken over the practice of Miss Prince’s
father, and they had renamed it after Mrs. Maclean’s birthplace.</p>

<p class='c008'>To-night, his wife and niece being by the table, the doctor
sat close to the fire smoking his pipe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dr. Tasker popped in to tea to-day,” observed Mrs.
Maclean. As her husband said nothing she went on: “He
waited quite a long while in the hope of seeing you. I’m
doubting, Jock, whether we’ve been quite fair to that young
man. He spoke very handsomely of you—he did indeed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve no need of his praise,” said the doctor dryly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t say you had. All the same I hope you’ll not
scold me for having asked him to supper to-morrow night.
He says Sunday is such a dull day in Grendon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t promise to stay in for him if I’m sent for,” said
Dr. Maclean, in a voice which his wife thought somewhat
tiresome.</p>

<p class='c008'>There had been a time, not so very long ago, when it was
she, rather than her husband, who had disliked the young
medical man who had suddenly “put up his plate,” as the saying
is, on the door of almost the last house in Grendon. But
Dr. Tasker had spoken to her very pleasantly at the cricket
match. He had made friends, too, with Jean, and so Mrs.
Maclean was now prepared to take him, at any rate in a
measure, to her kindly Scots heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a few moments there was silence in the room. Dr.
Maclean turned himself round, and his eyes rested with
appreciative affection on the bent head of the girl who even
in a few weeks had so much brightened and enlivened his
own and his wife’s childless home.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Jean’s hair was the colour of spun gold, and she had a
delicately clear skin, giving depth to her hazel eyes. But
her generous-lipped mouth was too large for beauty, and
her features were irregular. Yet she looked so happy-natured,
intelligent, and healthy, that the general impression
produced by her appearance was that of a pretty, as well as
that of a very agreeable girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>Perhaps she felt her uncle’s grateful, kindly glance, for
suddenly she looked up and smiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Uncle Jock?” she exclaimed, “a penny for your
thoughts!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder if I’d really better tell you my thoughts,” he
answered rather soberly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course you must!” cried his wife.</p>

<p class='c008'>She, too, put down her work for a moment on the table
and looked at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m thinking,” he said quietly, “that we won’t be keeping
our pretty Jean here for long. It’s all very well her being
boxed up every day in that china factory. There are always
half Saturdays and Sundays, to say nothing of holidays,
and young men will soon come courting at Bonnie Doon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean burst out laughing, but Mrs. Maclean felt vexed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Really, Jock,” she exclaimed, “what are you after saying
now? I’ve no liking for that sort of joke.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He wouldn’t say it if he thought it true,” said her niece
merrily. “I’ve been much disappointed in Terriford as regards
the supply of young men.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bide a wee, bide a wee,” said the doctor dryly. “A
young woman never knows when she’s going to meet Mr.
Right; he’s a way of appearing in the most unlikely places.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again his wife looked at him severely. “Jock, I’m surprised
at you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’d often be surprised if you could look straight into
my mind, woman,” said the doctor waggishly, tapping his
pipe against the side of the fireplace. And then, as her aunt
was still looking annoyed, Jean tactfully changed the subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish you would tell me what you think of Agatha
Cheale, Uncle Jock?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder what you think of her?” he parried.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hardly know her. I liked her the day of the cricket
match.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“Is that the only time you’ve seen her?” asked Mrs.
Maclean.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I saw her to-day,” said Jean slowly, “Mr. Garlett overtook
me after I had started walking home the field way. He
suggested I should go through his garden—and then such a
horrid thing happened!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What happened?” asked the husband and wife together.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We were going across the lawn when we suddenly heard
the sound of crying. It was coming, it seems, from Miss
Cheale’s sitting room. Mr. Garlett thought it was a child
who had hurt itself, and asked me to go into the house.
And then we found that it was Lucy Warren who was crying—and
that there was such a horrid scene going on! I’ve
never seen any one look as angry as Miss Cheale looked. I
thought her such a quiet person.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Maclean asked eagerly: “Why was she angry?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“From what I could make out,” said Jean, “Mrs. Garlett
heard the French window of the drawing room open in the
middle of last night. She thought it was a burglar, and she
insisted on going downstairs; so she and Miss Cheale went
downstairs together, and there was Lucy Warren with a
man! But he escaped by the window out into the garden
before they could see who it was.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t wonder Miss Cheale was angry!” exclaimed
Jean’s aunt. “I can hardly believe such a tale of Lucy
Warren. She’s such a superior-looking girl, such a pet, too,
of Miss Prince’s. Miss Prince was saying to me the other
day how sorry she was she had ever allowed Mrs. Garlett
to have Lucy, but she felt the Thatched House situation was
such a good one that she ought not to keep the girl from it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lucy will go back to her now. Miss Prince isn’t the
woman to let a good maid go begging,” observed Dr. Maclean.
“They didn’t say a word of all that to me this morning.”
He added, “I couldn’t think what had upset Mrs.
Garlett.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“When we came in, Miss Cheale was trying to get out of
Lucy who the man was,” went on Jean eagerly. “But all
she would say was that she didn’t see why she shouldn’t have
a talk with a friend anywhere she chose. She actually appealed
to Mr. Garlett to say if she wasn’t right!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What did he say?” asked Mrs. Maclean.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“In a way he took Lucy’s part, for he reminded Miss
Cheale that the drawing room was never used. But of
course that only made her more angry—in fact, she was
shaking with rage, her face was livid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was foolish of him to interfere,” observed the doctor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I slipped away as quickly as I could,” went
on the girl, “but as I went down the passage I heard Lucy
call out: ‘I hate you, Miss Cheale! I hate Mrs. Garlett! I
hate everybody in this house!’ Oh, it was dreadful—and I
felt so sorry for them all.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Five hours later Jean Bower lay asleep in the big, comfortable
bedroom which had been made so pretty for her by
her kind aunt. The girl stirred uneasily, for she was dreaming
a strange, a terrible, and most vivid dream.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was at the Etna China factory taking down letters
from the dictation of her employer, Mr. Garlett. Though
she had been at the factory for a full month Jean had seen
very little of the managing director. But they had made
friends during their walk from Grendon to Terriford, and
in her dream she was enjoying the change of taking down
dictation from a man who knew exactly what he wanted to
say instead of from weary-brained, hesitating old Mr. Dodson.
And then, suddenly looking up, she saw that, pressed
against the central pane of the window behind Mr. Garlett
was a face convulsed with hatred—and the face was that of
Agatha Cheale!</p>

<p class='c008'>A feeling of icy terror crept over her, for the managing
director’s room was on the first floor of the building, far
above the ground of the stone-paved courtyard round which
the Etna China factory had been built close on seventy years
ago.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a stifled cry the girl awoke and sat up in bed, the
horror of her nightmare still so vividly real that her teeth
were chattering and her hands trembling in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then there gradually came to her the reassuring knowledge
as to why she had dreamed that strange, unnatural
dream. It was of course owing to her having seen Agatha
Cheale, her face distorted with anger, dismissing Lucy Warren
at the Thatched House yesterday morning!</p>

<p class='c008'>But her feeling of reassurance and relief did not last long,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>for suddenly a stone came crashing in through the window
nearest to her. Jumping out of bed she rushed across the
room and threw up the lower sash of the window.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who’s there?” she called out, and then, “What do you
want?”</p>

<p class='c008'>To her amazement it was Harry Garlett’s voice that
called back, “Please forgive me, Miss Bower. I’ve come
for the doctor. My wife has been taken seriously ill. I
rang the night bell, but could get no answer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The night bell’s gone wrong. I’ll run and tell Uncle
Jock at once——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Leaving the window open, she hustled on a dressing gown
and ran down the passage.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle Jock!” she knocked on the door as hard as she
could. “Mr. Garlett has come to fetch you, for Mrs. Garlett
has been taken ill——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Maclean opened the bedroom door. “Go back to
bed, child; I’ll see to Harry Garlett.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Reluctantly the girl did as she was bid, for she had the
natural desire of youth to be in the middle of anything exciting
that is going on.</p>

<p class='c008'>To Jean Bower Mrs. Garlett was still a mere name, for
she had never seen the invalid. But already, though she
had only been working on and off with him for a very short
time, she had come to like the man every one called Harry
Garlett. She was a simple, straightforward, old-fashioned
girl. From her point of view all ordinary married people
love one another, and she believed her employer to be exceptionally
devoted to his ailing wife. There had been a
note of extreme anxiety and urgency in the now familiar
voice which had come up from the garden just now.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>As Dr. MacLean hurried by Harry Garlett’s side along the
road leading to the Thatched House he felt a good deal
disturbed. Though he had thought his patient more ailing
than usual the day before, there had been nothing to indicate
anything in the nature of a sudden seizure.</p>

<p class='c008'>“D’you know exactly when your wife was taken ill?”
he asked, aware that his companion’s bedroom was in quite
another part of the Thatched House, some way from the
rooms occupied by the ailing woman and Agatha Cheale.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“She was taken ill early in the night. But Miss Cheale
thought she’d be able to manage without calling me, and then,
suddenly, Emily seemed to collapse! So I dressed and hurried
along to fetch you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They walked on in silence till they turned in through the
gate of the delightful garden which surrounded the house
for which they were bound, and as they hastened up the
avenue, Dr. Maclean noticed that there were no lights in
any of the windows. Agatha Cheale had evidently not seen
fit to rouse the servants.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two men hurried together through the dark hall into
the broad corridor which ran through the spacious old house;
but at the foot of the staircase the master of the house hung
back.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think I’ll go up with you,” he exclaimed. “I’ll
wait in my study, Maclean. I can’t do any good up there,
and it unnerves me to see Emily suffer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right!” cried the doctor hastily; and he hastened
on, familiar with every inch of the way, till he reached the
upstairs corridor, which, unlike the lower part of the house,
was brilliantly lighted.</p>

<p class='c008'>All at once he started back—for from behind a big wardrobe
there had suddenly emerged an odd-looking figure clad
in a drab-coloured ulster.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s only me, sir.” The reassuring words were uttered
in a frightened whisper; and with astonishment Dr. Maclean
recognized Lucy Warren, the pretty parlour-maid who had
got into such trouble the night before.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mrs. Garlett’s been moaning something awful,” she murmured,
“but she’s left off now. You won’t tell her that
you’ve seen me, sir, will you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not if you’ll go straight back to bed!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The little incident made an unpleasant impression on the
doctor. He told himself that the young woman might at
least have gone and seen if she could do anything to help
relieve her sick mistress.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, as he approached his patient’s room, Dr. Maclean
half-unconsciously slackened his footsteps and listened.</p>

<p class='c008'>But no sound fell on his ear; indeed the silence brooding
over the brilliantly lit corridor seemed almost uncanny.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet the bedroom door was ajar, and, hearing his footsteps,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Agatha Cheale opened the door wide, and came out into the
passage, a finger to her lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was dressed in a big white coverall. It accentuated
the intense pallor of her face and made her slender figure
look thicker than usual.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mrs. Garlett is asleep now,” she whispered, “but she’s
been in awful pain, and I’m sorry I didn’t send for you before.
I’ve always been able to manage her in her previous
night attacks, but this time she’s been really very bad! I do
hope—oh, I do <i>hope</i>, Dr. Maclean, that you won’t think I
was to blame not to send for you at once?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was so unlike her usual quiet sensible self that the
doctor felt alarmed, in spite of himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t suppose I could have done any good if I had
come an hour ago,” he said soothingly. “I take it she overate
herself last night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She did indeed—that’s what upset her, of course.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As he moved toward the now open door he told himself,
not for the first time, that it was strange that Agatha Cheale,
in this one matter of diet, seemed powerless to control his
patient. But there it was! Like so many people with delicate
digestions, Mrs. Garlett had always had a fanciful,
queer, greedy kind of appetite. Sometimes she would eat
hardly anything for days together, and then she would
grossly overeat herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose,” he said in a low voice, “that you’ve given her
brandy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I have—but it hasn’t done her any good.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Agatha Cheale still spoke in an agitated, almost hysterical,
whisper.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, for no particular reason, though he remembered
doing so afterwards, Dr. Maclean asked Agatha Cheale a
casual question: “Has her husband seen her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, he thought it best to go off at once for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At last, together, they walked through into the sick woman’s
room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Garlett’s bedchamber was the largest in the house,
and, like the drawing room below, was somewhat overcrowded
with heavy early Victorian mahogany furniture.</p>

<p class='c008'>Coming out of the brightly lit corridor Dr. Maclean, for a
moment, saw nothing, for the one electric lamp which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>turned on was heavily shaded. But for the fact that he knew
where every chair and table stood, he would have knocked
into something.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do turn on another light,” he whispered rather crossly.
“I can’t see at all!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Obediently she turned on the two naked lights hanging
above the dressing-table, but the big curtained four-post
bed in which the sick woman lay remained in deep shadow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Before I see her, tell me exactly what she ate last night,”
said the doctor in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Standing opposite Dr. Maclean, just under the two bright
naked lights, Agatha Cheale, her face pale and strained,
told her story.</p>

<p class='c008'>“About seven last evening I went to see Miss Prince for
a few minutes and, while I was away, from what I can make
out Mr. Garlett came up to sit with Mrs. Garlett before
dressing for dinner. Unfortunately some forced strawberries
which Miss Prince had brought in the morning had
been taken up and left in the corridor outside. Mr. Garlett
seems to have brought them in here—I suppose to show
them to Mrs. Garlett. She said she would like to eat some
of them then, before her supper. He stupidly allowed her
to do so, and she ate them all—a plateful—with probably a
lot of sugar added. So of course I wasn’t surprised when
she called out to me about two hours ago that she felt
ill!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did she take anything after the strawberries?” asked the
doctor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course she did. She began to feel hungry about
8.30 and then she had her supper—a nice bit of grilled fish
and some stewed apples. But her supper didn’t do her any
good on the top of the strawberries——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t suppose it did,” agreed the doctor dryly. “And
now let me have a look at her——”</p>

<p class='c008'>As he took a step toward the bed Agatha Cheale suddenly
put her right hand on his arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>Surprised, he stopped, and she whispered hesitatingly:
“I’ve been wondering—I suppose you wouldn’t like to have
a second opinion?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He shook his head decidedly, secretly very much surprised
that her nerve should so far have given way. What good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>could a second opinion do in a case of severe indigestion?
Why, the idea was absurd! Then he reminded himself that
Agatha Cheale was not a trained nurse—in spite of her war
experiences.</p>

<p class='c008'>He walked quickly across to the sick woman’s four-post
bed, lifted the heavy, stiff, silk-lined calendered chintz curtain,
and then turned on the light in a reading lamp which
stood on a small pedestal table.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Garlett was lying on her back in the middle of the big
bed, and Dr. Maclean, taking up the lamp, leant for a long,
long moment over his patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he turned, with a blanched face, and still unconsciously
holding the lamp in his hand, to the woman who
stood waiting over by the dressing-table, the light beating
down on her tired drawn face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’s not asleep—she’s dead,” he said quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dead! Not dead? Oh, don’t say she’s dead!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Agatha Cheale’s voice rose into a kind of shriek.</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor put the lamp down. He took her hand and
held it firmly in his.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush!” he exclaimed, kindly and yet authoritatively.
“I’m sorry to have given you such a shock, Miss Cheale,
but I’m not so surprised as you seem to be. Her heart was
in a very bad state. You have nothing to reproach yourself
with—you have been wonderfully good and patient with her,
poor soul.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can nothing be done?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was looking at him with an extraordinary expression
of horror and of pleading on her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing,” he answered gravely.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a pause; the doctor dropped the hand he had
been holding in so firm a clasp.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Prince’s dish of strawberries killed this poor woman
as surely as if she had taken a dose of poison,” he said
grimly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will never let Mr. Garlett know that, will you?” she
whispered.</p>

<p class='c008'>He made no answer, and perhaps she saw by his expression
that he was telling himself that even the most sensible
women are sometimes foolishly sentimental, for a little colour
came back into her face.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“Shall I go down and tell him—or will you?” she asked,
in a voice that had suddenly become composed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll tell him, of course.”</p>

<p class='c008'>To his relief he saw her eyes become suffused with tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We little thought yesterday morning that this would be
the solution of your problem,” he said feelingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a horrible, horrible solution!” she exclaimed violently.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again Dr. Maclean made no answer, for he did not, could
not, agree with her. To his mind, the death of Mrs. Garlett
was bound to turn out a blessing, not only to the young
woman who had tended her so faithfully, if unlovingly, for
over a year, but also to the dead woman’s husband.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hard cases make bad law; Dr. Maclean was no advocate
of easy divorce, but to his mind there was something intensely
repellent in the marriage of a strong healthy man to
a hopeless invalid. Deep down in his heart the honest Scotsman
knew what would have happened to himself had he been
in the shoes of Harry Garlett. He knew that his flesh and
blood would not have borne such a difficult, unnatural situation,
and he had long admired the young man’s straight,
simple, clean way of life. Thanks to that dish of early
strawberries, Harry Garlett would now be able to remake his
life on happy, natural lines.</p>

<p class='c008'>Slightly ashamed of such thoughts coming at such a time,
he glanced at the young woman before him. Would she
now become the real mistress of this delightful house? The
doctor suspected she would make a try for it. But he could
not help hoping that the newly made widower would in time
meet with a happier fate than marriage with this secretive
and, he suspected, very jealous-natured woman. Dr. Maclean
liked Harry Garlett well enough to hope that, after a
decent interval, this now mournful house would be filled
with gay, wholesome, girlish laughter, and the patter of little
feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>And while these secret thoughts were rushing through his
brain Agatha Cheale was standing motionless, a look of
stark terror on her bloodless face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go into your room,” he said at last, “and try and get a
little rest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Together they left the room of death, and the doctor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>quickly made his way downstairs through the still, silent
house.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rather unreasonably, it gave Dr. Maclean somewhat of
a shock to find Harry Garlett comfortably stretched out in
an easy chair, reading a novel. But as the doctor advanced
into the room the master of the Thatched House leaped
to his feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well!” he exclaimed, “I hope you’ve made her more
comfortable, Maclean? I’m sorry to have dragged you out
like this, but Miss Cheale was so very much upset and worried——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then something in the gravity of the doctor’s face pulled
the speaker up short. He added quickly: “Isn’t she so
well? Would you like me to get Tasker?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean took a step forward; he put his hand on the
younger man’s shoulder:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Garlett, I’ve a sad thing to break to you, man——”</p>

<p class='c008'>He waited a moment, then said quietly: “Your poor
wife is dead—an obvious case of heart failure following an
attack of acute indigestion.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dead?”</p>

<p class='c008'>As Harry Garlett repeated the word his face became
deeply, deeply troubled. “She seemed so well, for her,
last evening,” he said slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor answered in a low voice: “You should have
resisted her wish for those strawberries.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett looked puzzled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never gave her any strawberries, Maclean. There are
no strawberries yet—it’s much too early.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the doctor’s turn to be surprised.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understood from Miss Cheale that you had shown your
wife a dish of forced strawberries brought her by Miss
Prince, and that then she had insisted on having them before
her supper.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never saw any strawberries, and I was only with her
for a very few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then one of the maids must have given them to her,”
observed the doctor. “But if it hadn’t been that dish of
strawberries, it would have been something else. It’s clear
from the state she was in that anything might have caused
her death.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>As if hardly knowing what he was doing, Harry Garlett
sat down again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—I can’t believe it,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As far as the poor soul could be made happy, you made
her happy, Garlett,” said Dr. Maclean feelingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder if I did—I wonder if I did! You must have
often thought it strange that I was away so much, Maclean.
But honestly—it was poor Emily’s own wish.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was speaking with deep emotion now, staring down at
the floor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“After I left the army, it took me some time to realize
how really ailing she was, though, as you may remember, I
did at that time stay at home a good deal. And then one
day she sent me a note by hand to the factory——”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked up. “That note, Maclean, was my order of
release! I have kept it, and I should like you to see it some
day. In it she said that she wanted me to be happy—that
Dodson was quite up to looking after the business, and that
she did not want me ever to feel that I couldn’t do anything
which would add to my innocent pleasure in life—because
of her state.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean was more touched than he would have thought
possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dear me,” he exclaimed, “that was very decent of her!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was,” agreed the other, “it was indeed, Maclean. And
she meant every word of what she wrote. It was only yesterday,
our thirteenth wedding-day, that she said to me,
‘I don’t like your spending a week-end at home. It doesn’t
seem natural, my dear.’ Thank God I did—thank God I
did!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think everything has gone very much better here this
last year,” said the doctor thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How d’you mean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I mean because of Miss Cheale.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The other did not answer for a moment, and then he said
in a low voice:</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s true in a way, though I don’t think Emily liked
Miss Cheale. I have at times regretted having agreed that
she should come.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They weren’t the kind of women who would naturally
take to one another,” answered Dr. Maclean.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“And yet my wife quite liked that worthless brother of
Miss Cheale’s. He actually came to tea with her the other
day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mrs. Garlett always liked men better than women,” said
the doctor dryly. He had at once guessed the identity of
Lucy Warren’s drawing-room visitor, and it had amused
him to picture “poor Emily’s” wrath had she even dimly
suspected the fact.</p>

<p class='c008'>He added, after a pause: “Your wife was a generous
sort, Garlett—I mean about money.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, she was that, certainly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Both men remained silent for a moment. It was true
that the poor woman now lying dead upstairs had always
shown herself generous about money, though not, excepting
to her husband, about anything else. But now was not the
moment to recall her cantankerous and narrow outlook on
life.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” said the doctor at last, “I must be going now.
I’ll leave a note in her letter-box for Miss Prince as I go by.
It will be just as well for Agatha Cheale to have a friend
with her this morning; she has had a terrible shock.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She must have had,” said Harry Garlett; but he did not
speak with his usual hearty kindliness.</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor looked at him rather hard. Then he again
put his hand on the younger man’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, my friend, I know you’ve been a good husband
to that poor soul. But you’re still a young man, and
a new chapter of your life has begun.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t feel like that,” muttered Harry Garlett in a low
voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course you don’t! But still it’s the truth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He added, measuring his words: “If I were you I should
go away at once, as soon as the funeral is over, for a real
holiday—such a holiday as you’ve never had. Don’t come
back here till Christmas! Dodson’s getting a very old man;
you’ll soon either have to manage the business yourself or
get another partner, so take a holiday while you can get one.”</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Poor Emily Garlett’s funeral took place on a beautiful
bright spring morning. The broad sunny street of
Terriford was filled with motors and carriages, and quite a
concourse of people had come out from Grendon, as well
as from the surrounding villages, to testify their respect for
popular Harry Garlett, both as famous cricketer and as a
generous employer of labour.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every one saw him, for he followed his wife’s coffin on
foot. So also did the various other people closely concerned
with the departed lady.</p>

<p class='c008'>Agatha Cheale was ashen pale, but looked very attractive in
her close, nunlike bonnet and severely plain black dress. The
few who knew him noticed that Miss Cheale’s brother was
not there; but Mrs. Warren could have told them that her
lodger had left the farm two days ago, so recovered in health,
so blithesome, so merry, that, though still unnaturally thin, he
was scarcely the same man as the pale, coughing, queer, and
clever gentleman who had come to her last February.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. and Mrs. Maclean, accompanied by their niece, walked
a little apart from Miss Prince and Miss Cheale. Lucy was
not with the group of servants all clad in handsome black
at their master’s expense. She had left the Thatched House
the afternoon after Mrs. Garlett’s death, and to-day she
had elected to stay at home to mind the farm. This had
enabled Mrs. Warren to be present at the funeral, leaning
on the arm of her brother, Enoch Bent, head clerk of Mr.
Toogood the lawyer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Little by little the mourners all passed through the lych-gate
into the ancient churchyard. The rector had a good
voice, and tears rose to many eyes as he read the noble,
solemn words of the burial service.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was remembered afterward that Harry Garlett, though
he looked sad, was absolutely composed. When the burial
was over he lingered for a few minutes talking to the rector,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>doubtless in the hope that the crowd would disperse. Then
he quietly walked down the short, broad village street, and so
through into the beautiful garden of the house which somehow
he had never quite regarded as his property, if only because
it was there that he had first known his wife, and
where, as people sometimes unkindly put it, he had “hung up
his hat” when he married, instead of taking his bride to a
new home.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is fortunate indeed that men and women cannot read
each other’s thoughts, for, truth to tell, during the whole of
his wife’s funeral service, Harry Garlett’s mind had been
most uncomfortably full of another woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>To this woman, none other than Agatha Cheale, he had
written a formal note that morning saying he would like to
see her after the funeral for a few minutes. And now he
wondered whether she expected him to go to Miss Prince’s
house, where she had been staying the last few days, or
whether he would find her waiting for him in the Thatched
House in the room which, till his wife’s death, had been
known as “Miss Cheale’s room.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He went into the empty hall, took off his hat, but still
wearing his great coat, hurried down the passage. Then,
after a moment’s pause, he knocked at the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>A quiet voice said “Come in,” and as he entered the
room he saw Agatha Cheale standing by the empty fireplace.
All the little intimate possessions which cause a room to be
associated with one personality had been cleared away.
Already his late wife’s companion looked, as well as felt, a
stranger in this house where she had spent so secretly dramatic,
while so openly calm, a year of her life.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now she gazed with sunken, burning eyes at the man
who stood before her. How well he looked, how young,
how strong!—his life, which in the last few days she had
come to realize would never be shared by her, open before
him. Deep in her unhappy, tormented heart there had survived
up to to-day a glimmer of hope. True, he had obviously
avoided her during the last few days, but might not
that be owing to his undoubted affection, or rather respect,
for his late wife? Now that faint glimmer of hope died as
she gazed into his set, almost stern, face.</p>

<p class='c008'>There welled up in her heart a terrible tide of that acrid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>bitterness which is born of thwarted love and ambition.
But being a brave as well as a proud woman, she only said:
“I’m glad it was such a fine day—that makes such a difference
to a funeral.” And he answered eagerly: “Yes, indeed!”
grateful for her commonplace words.</p>

<p class='c008'>With an obvious effort, he exclaimed: “I want to tell
you how grateful I feel for all you did for my poor wife.
Your being here has made all the difference this last year.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She said nothing, and, speaking more quickly, he went on:
“I have to thank you for myself, as well as for poor Emily.
It was such an infinite comfort, each time I went away,
to feel that I was leaving my wife with someone I could trust,
as I knew I could trust you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He waited a moment, and as she still remained silent
while looking at him with a terrible fixed look of—was it
reproach?—he took an envelope out of his pocket.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have made up the enclosed cheque,” he said awkwardly,
“to the end of the year. I am glad to say Emily left you a
thousand pounds. So I do hope you’ll manage to get a good
rest before you start work again. From something Miss
Prince said the other day, I gather you’re taking a post
connected with some kind of Russian business house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” she said quietly, “they were the people I was
with before I came here, and they’ve often asked me to come
back. It’s interesting work, and I’m in general sympathy
with their objects.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bolshevik objects?” he suggested with a half smile, and
without meaning what he said. But she, without a glimmer
of an answering smile, replied: “Yes, Bolshevik objects.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A look of bewilderment came over his open face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I had no idea that you and your brother shared that sort
of view!” he exclaimed, “deep as I know is your attachment
for him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We agree as to politics,” she answered, as if the words
were being forced out of her.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then at last, almost as if reluctantly, she took the
envelope from his hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you for this,” she said coldly, “and for telling me
of Mrs. Garlett’s unexpected thought for me. I do not want
a holiday, but now I may be able to send my brother abroad
this next winter, if he lives as long.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“I was coming to that,” said Harry Garlett quickly.
“I’m going away for a long holiday—certainly till Christmas,
perhaps longer. But I’m keeping the household here together,
and I’ve been wondering whether your brother would
come and stay at the Thatched House as my guest, at any
rate through the summer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She shook her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think I ought to tell you, Mr. Garlett, that his coming
here is out of the question. I’m afraid, nay, I’m certain,
that he was the man Lucy Warren let into the drawing room
that night——”</p>

<p class='c008'>A look of anger and disgust flashed into his face. So she
had succeeded in rousing him at last?</p>

<p class='c008'>She sighed, a weary, listless sigh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As I think I told you long ago, my brother’s one real
interest in life is what he calls ‘falling in love’—and always
with some entirely unsuitable person.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett softened; he remembered very well his
surprise when she had first told him about the unprincipled
sickly brother whom she yet loved so dearly, and of whom
she was, in a sense, proud.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I feel grieved,” he said feelingly, “that you have this real
anxiety always with you; I wish I could help you with it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No one can help me with it. I knew he was bound to
get into a scrape with some woman here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What an extraordinary way to go on!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Extraordinary to you, no doubt. But you are a Galahad,
Mr. Garlett.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her words were like the lash of a whip: he grew red under
his tan, and looking at her straight for the first time during
this, to him, most trying conversation, “I’m a very ordinary
chap,” he said deliberately.</p>

<p class='c008'>Neither of them spoke for a few moments. Harry Garlett
turned and looked unseeingly out of the window. He
was longing for the uncomfortable interview to end, and it
was with relief that he heard her say:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must be going back to the Thatched Cottage now.
Good-bye, Mr. Garlett, and thank you for all your kindness.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-bye and good luck!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He tried to wring her hand, but it felt like a lump of dead,
cold flesh.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>All at once the door opened behind them. “Agatha?
Oh, here you are!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Miss Prince.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I beg your pardon,” she exclaimed, glancing sharply from
the one to the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We were just saying good-bye,” said Harry Garlett
quickly. “And I’ll bid you good-bye, too, Miss Prince, for
I’m going away this afternoon, and I don’t expect to be back
this side of Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good gracious, man! Are you going round the world?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I haven’t made up my mind what I’m going to do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And who will look after the factory?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dodson and Miss Bower. Come, Miss Prince”—his
look challenged her—“you’ve never credited me with doing
much of the work there, eh?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Harry Garlett was lying on the bank of a Norwegian
fjord. It was a beautiful warm September
day. He felt well in soul and body, and intended to give
himself three more months’ good holiday.</p>

<p class='c008'>With just a touch of reluctance he opened a packet of
letters which had followed him to this remote, delicious place.
Old Dodson’s letter, doubtless a brief dictated summary of
what had been happening at the factory, was, as usual, addressed
in the girlish handwriting of Jean Bower.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sight of that handwriting made his thoughts stray
for a while to the place which he still called “home.” He
was indeed a lucky chap to have such a steady old soul as
Dodson, and such a thoroughly nice, sensible young woman
as was Jean Bower, looking after the business from which
he drew part of his large income.</p>

<p class='c008'>He opened the envelope and then, as he read the typewritten
sheet, his face clouded with deep and even deeper
dismay.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Dear Mr. Garlett</span>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>I hope you will not think I am exceeding my duty in writing to
tell you that I am becoming very anxious about the state, not only
of Mr. Dodson’s health, but also of his brain.</p>

<p class='c010'>It seems a shame to interrupt your holiday, but I really don’t
know what to do. I am supposed to be the only person who has
any influence over Mr. Dodson, but I have very little influence indeed,
none where the real conduct of the business is concerned. My uncle
agrees with me that you ought to know the state of things as soon as
possible.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Believe me to remain, yours sincerely,</div>
      <div class='line in32'><span class='sc'>Jean Bower</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>He got up from where he had been lying so luxuriously in
the long grass, feeling as if he hadn’t a care in the world.
There was evidently nothing for it but to go home and face
out a difficult and disagreeable situation. And yet he felt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>sharply annoyed with Jean Bower. No doubt she was exaggerating
as to old Dodson’s condition. But there it was;
he couldn’t neglect such a letter as that! He told himself
that he had been a fool to leave a girl in so responsible a
position.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>This was why his friends and neighbours welcomed Harry
Garlett back in their midst full three months before he had
been expected home.</p>

<p class='c008'>In such a place as Grendon everybody is interested in
every other body’s business. As soon as he had come back
Harry Garlett had sent off Jean Bower for a short holiday,
and soon, to his mingled amusement and annoyance, he found
he could hardly take a step down the High Street without
some good-natured gossip telling him how splendidly the girl
had managed poor crazy old Dodson! Even his head foreman
seemed quite lost without her, and, as a matter of fact,
things didn’t begin going right again till she came back, and
in her quiet and diffident, yet competent, way, began to
“put him wise” with regard to all those matters which Dodson
had always tried to keep jealously in his own hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, as the days went on, Harry Garlett began to
find himself taking a keen, even an excited, interest in his
work. The business which had meant little to him in the old
days now gripped and absorbed him, or so he honestly
thought, to the exclusion of all else.</p>

<p class='c008'>Times were bad, every one in the country economizing,
going in more and more for the cheap, rather than for the
good, and the china made in the Etna works had never been
cheap, though always good. And soon it became known in
the town that Harry Garlett was trying to prove what even
now few people believe—that is, that homely, everyday
objects can be cheap and beautiful at the same time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Never had time gone by so quickly as with these two
eager workers! In the old days time had hung sometimes
very heavily on Harry Garlett’s hands during the late autumn
and winter months. But now he found there were not hours
enough for all he wanted to do.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the brain side of the business increasing at the rate
it was doing, it became necessary to engage a new shorthand
writer, and at the suggestion of Jean Bower, the daughter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of a local solicitor killed in the war was given the coveted
post. This was considered a kindly and generous act on
Miss Bower’s part. Most young women in the position in
which she found herself would not have cared to have another
girl, younger, most people would have said prettier,
than herself, sharing her secretarial position.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, as a matter of fact, Jean no longer took down letters.
Almost at once, though neither she nor Harry Garlett
realized it, she had slipped into the position of a partner.
They were a happy family at the Etna China works. “All
jolly and friendly together,” as the head foreman expressed
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, late in November, a word was uttered which
changed, for ever, both their lives.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Sunday evening, and Harry Garlett was on his way
to supper at Bonnie Doon. He went out often to dinner,
having a large circle of acquaintances, but he generally had
supper with the Macleans on Sunday, and as it was with him
a dull, solitary day he used to look forward very eagerly to
the evening. Since his return home, on the pretext that he
was still in mourning, he no longer accepted invitations for
week-end visits.</p>

<p class='c008'>To-night, as he passed the Thatched Cottage, Miss Prince
came running out of her door; it was almost as if she had
been waiting for him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Harry!” she exclaimed. “May I walk a few yards with
you? I want to ask you a favour.” Inconsequently, she
added: “Your wife and I were lifelong friends, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She began walking along the road by his side, anxious to
be quite out of earshot of her maid, who, by the way, was
Lucy Warren. Lucy had always been a favourite of Miss
Prince, and, to Agatha Cheale’s indignation, after the girl’s
dismissal from the Thatched House, she had at once taken
her back into her own service.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Miss Prince, what can I do for you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett never felt quite at ease with the gossiping
spinster. They had once, years ago, had a real quarrel. He
had caught her trying to make mischief between himself and
his wife, and though they had formally “made it up” neither
really liked the other.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“If and when Jean Bower gives up her job at the Etna
works, I do beg you, Harry, to offer the position to Agatha
Cheale.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Agatha Cheale?” Harry Garlett repeated the name mechanically.</p>

<p class='c008'>His whole mind, aye, and his whole heart, were full of the
first words she had spoken—“If and when Jean Bower gives
up her job——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you any reason for thinking that Miss Bower is
going to give up her position?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He felt—he could not see, for it was dark—that Miss
Prince smiled. It was a smile he knew and had always
hated, for it generally presaged on her part the saying of
something spiteful and unpleasant. But, whatever it was
she was about to say, she now seemed in no hurry to say it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” she said at last, “you go to the Macleans so often
I should have thought you must have guessed what’s in the
wind?”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not true that he went often to Bonnie Doon. As a
matter of fact he had a curious distaste in seeing Jean Bower
in the company of her uncle and aunt, for the reason that
they two had now many interests in common that they could
not share with outsiders—however kind those outsiders
might be.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the wind, Miss Prince? I don’t understand what
you mean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you were living where I live, on the road, you’d notice
how often Dr. Tasker goes in and out of Bonnie Doon.
Why, it’s as good as a play! There was a time when the
man would hardly put his foot in Terriford village. We
were supposed to belong to Dr. Maclean—and we did, too.
There wasn’t much love lost between them before Miss Jean
came along—but now they’re kissing kind! I’m expecting
to hear of Jean’s engagement to Dr. Tasker any day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett fenced with his tormentor. “I now see
your point about Miss Cheale,” he said quietly, “but I doubt
if she would give up her work in London.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She gave it up before to please you.” Her tone was
significant, though he could not see her meaning look. She
added hastily:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Agatha is devoted to this place, and so I thought I would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>take time by the forelock. Once it’s known that Jean Bower
is leaving the factory, there’ll be plenty of people anxious to
work their idle, silly daughters into her pleasant job. If you
are wise, Harry Garlett, you will bear Agatha Cheale in
mind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will, indeed, Miss Prince. Thank you for mentioning
her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince turned back toward her house, while Harry
Garlett walked on, in a turmoil of astonishment and, yes, of
bitter, intolerable jealousy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean Bower and that red-haired brute, Tasker? Why,
the mere thought of their names being associated in the way
he had just heard it done made him feel beside himself with
anger.</p>

<p class='c008'>He quickened his footsteps, even now unaware of what
was the matter with him. Indeed, as he went up the drive
leading to the Macleans’ front door, he seriously told himself
that his feeling of utter dismay was owing to the loss
Jean would be to him from a business point of view.</p>

<p class='c008'>A most miserable evening followed. Whenever Harry
Garlett had a chance of doing so he would stare furtively,
his heart full of jealousy and suspicious misery, at Jean
Bower’s bright, animated face.</p>

<p class='c008'>He wondered whether Tasker had been there on Friday
afternoon? The day before yesterday Miss Bower had
asked for the afternoon off—a most unusual thing for her
to do.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean? What a lovely unusual name! Till this evening
she had been “Miss Bower” even in Harry Garlett’s inmost
thoughts. Henceforth she would always be Jean....</p>

<p class='c008'>He was so silent, so constrained in his manner, that the
doctor and Mrs. Maclean noticed that something was wrong.
But they were, as Jean’s aunt expressed it afterwards, a
hundred miles from suspecting the truth. By both these
good people Harry Garlett was still regarded as the newly
made widower of “poor Emily,” and as for their dear little
niece, they were secretly happy in the belief that she would
soon be Mrs. Tasker, settled within a pleasantly easy distance
of themselves, with her future assured, even if the young
medical man, whom they had regarded with such very
different feelings till a few months ago, were not exactly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>a hero of romance. Tasker was proceeding in his wooing
in a leisurely, cautious manner, but neither of the onlookers
suspected the truth—the truth being that he felt as if there
were an invisible, but strong, barrier between the girl and
himself.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The next morning Jean was ten minutes late in arriving
at the factory. As a rule she was five minutes early. But
some one had come to Bonnie Doon with a cut hand, and
the doctor, who generally motored her into Grendon, had
wished to attend to the injury himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those ten minutes had seemed to Harry Garlett an eternity.
That she who was always early should be late, seemed
to his jealous, excited fancy to confirm Miss Prince’s outspoken
hint, and when at last she did come in, with a half-smiling
apology, he turned on her roughly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope that you won’t be delayed like this again, Miss
Bower, however good the reason. It gives a bad example,”
and she was frightened, cowed, by his look of mingled anger
and contempt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Each of them got through his and her morning work with
difficulty—Jean often on the point of tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>What had happened to her kind, considerate employer,
the man with whom, in her guilelessness, she had thought
herself almost on the terms of a younger sister?</p>

<p class='c008'>At last, at about a quarter to one, he turned on her with:
“And what do you see to admire, Miss Bower, in Dr.
Tasker?”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a monstrous, an outrageous, question, and the
colour flew into her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned away and answered in what she meant should
be a cheerful, chaffing voice, though she felt not only
astounded, but hot with anger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What makes you think I admire Dr. Tasker, Mr.
Garlett?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He said, “I’m told you do,” in a short, cutting voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>This time she remained silent, and after pretending for
a moment or two to be busily engaged in correcting the
proofs of a new trade catalogue she put her pen down and
turned to walk toward the door—no longer mistress of
herself.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Harry Garlett leaped to his feet, and before she could
reach the door he caught her up and masterfully—yet, oh
how gently—took her in his arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jean! Don’t be cruel,” he whispered. “Surely—surely
you know I love you—adore you—worship you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>For a long moment they gazed into each other’s eyes,
and then his lips sought and found her soft, quivering
mouth....</p>

<p class='c008'>Early that afternoon—it was the first of December—Jean
went home and quietly told her dismayed aunt that
she and Harry Garlett loved one another. She admitted
that it was very strange that neither of them had known
it before to-day, but she went on to say that now they did
know it, they were very, very happy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Poor Mrs. Maclean! For the first time in her life she
felt as if she could not cope with a situation—and she prayed
for the doctor’s return home.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when he did come in, tired out, from a difficult case,
he only said grumpily: “So that was what was the matter
with him yesterday? We were fools not to have foreseen
it,” and telephoned to ask Harry Garlett to supper.</p>

<p class='c008'>How different was this evening from that spent by them
all the night before! Even Mrs. Maclean, staid Scots body
that she was, caught fire at the great shaft of pure white
flame which seemed to envelop those two who had now become
lovers.</p>

<p class='c008'>To her husband she might mutter that it was only just
over six months since “poor Emily” died, but to herself
she kept saying how wonderful, how uplifting, even only
to watch, was this ecstatic passion between a man she had
secretly imagined incapable of love, and her matter-of-fact,
capable, merry little Jean.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean was far from pleased. He kept wondering,
ruefully, what he should say to Tasker. The man would
undoubtedly be bitterly disappointed. Nay, more, he might
feel that he hadn’t been treated quite fairly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor was also uncomfortably aware that there would
be “talk,” and almost as if his wife were able to see into his
mind, just before Harry Garlett at last got up, Mrs. Maclean
suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s one thing I’m minded to say, Harry. I’m afraid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Jean mustn’t go to the factory any more—not till you’re
married, that is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As both the girl and her lover exclaimed against the cruel
decision, Dr. Maclean clinched the matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your aunt’s quite right,” he said firmly. “Grendon’s
the greatest place for gossip in England.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We don’t mind gossip.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean looked gravely at the two fine-looking young
people standing before him in the lamplight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett had never looked his age, and now, to-night,
he looked years younger than yesterday. As for Jean, not
only her radiant face, but her supple, graceful figure seemed
transfigured—she looked a lovely ageless nymph no sorrow
or decay could touch.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I fancy that even you would mind being spied on and
sniggered at,” said the doctor dryly.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>And so there began for those two who loved one another
so dearly a strange period of mingled pain and bliss. They
hated to be apart, and yet they were not allowed to be
together in what seemed to them both the only seemly,
natural way—that in their joint everyday work.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Maclean showed what even Jean considered an almost
absurd fear of what even the people of Terriford might
say. She did not like the lovers to stray outside the large
garden and paddock of Bonnie Doon, and she ordained that
“for the present” the engagement should remain private.</p>

<p class='c008'>Small wonder that at the end of about ten days Miss
Prince asked inquisitively: “Why has Jean left off going
to the factory?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jean has only had a few days’ holiday since she first
went there,” answered Jean’s aunt evasively.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Miss Prince shook her head. “I don’t know why
you should hide the truth from me, Mrs. Maclean? It’s
been plain for a good while what was the matter with Harry
Garlett. I knew it before he knew it himself! But I didn’t
believe that the girl liked him. I thought she preferred
Dr. Tasker. Well, well! Poor Emily has soon been forgotten——”</p>

<p class='c008'>After some three weeks of this state of things had gone on,
Dr. Maclean suddenly said to his wife: “There’s nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>for it but to get them married! There’ll only be more talk
if they don’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And Mrs. Maclean answered with something like a groan:
“There’ll be a lot of talk if they do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but what’s to be done, my dear? The poor fellow
has never been in love till now, so he doesn’t know how to
behave——”</p>

<p class='c008'>And so it was that at last it was decided that the two
should be married on the nineteenth of December, by special
license, very quietly, not to say secretly, in Terriford village
church. They would then go to London for a week’s honeymoon,
and, during that week, Dr. and Mrs. Maclean would
tell all their neighbours and friends what had happened.</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor and his wife reminded each other that there
was something about Jean which attracted even cold people.
She had such a bright, happy, eager nature. As for Harry
Garlett, he was always ready to do anybody a good turn,
and also, as a great cricketer, was very popular. Though
some old-fashioned people might be shocked by so early a
second marriage, every one knew that his late wife had been
an invalid for years.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was only one person to whom, for a reason he
would have found it difficult to define even to himself,
Harry Garlett felt bound to announce his forthcoming marriage.
This was Agatha Cheale.</p>

<p class='c008'>In answer to his brief letter, there came one even briefer:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Dear Mr. Garlett</span>,</p>

<p class='c010'>I am interested in your news, and I trust you will be as happy as
you deserve to be.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yours sincerely,</div>
      <div class='line in20'><span class='sc'>Agatha Cheale</span>.</div>
    </div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>“I am the most fortunate man in England! I am the
happiest man in the world!”</p>

<p class='c008'>As he swung along in the bright winter sunshine on the
field path which formed a short cut to the town, again and
again these words seemed to hammer themselves, in joyful
cadence, on Harry Garlett’s brain.</p>

<p class='c008'>What we call the human heart is full of the strangest
twists and turnings, and so, though Garlett’s heart was
full of Jean Bower, he threw an affectionately retrospective
thought to his late wife. He and “poor Emily” had never
had a really cross word during those long, quiet years before
the war, when, most fortunately for himself, he had not
even dimly apprehended what the passion of love can mean
in a human life, and how it will make beautiful, and intimately
delicious, even the most prosaic facts of day-to-day
existence.</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at his watch. It was a quarter past ten. In
just twenty-four hours from now he and Jean would be
starting for their one week’s honeymoon in London.</p>

<p class='c008'>His face softened. There came upon it a great awe. God!
How he loved her. Every moment they spent together he
seemed to discover some new, hitherto hidden beauty of
mind, soul, or body in this wonderful, still mysterious, but
wholly delightful young creature who not only allowed him
to worship her but—miracle of miracles—returned his passion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such were the disconnected but wholly contented thoughts
which filled half an hour of the last easy, unquestioning, and,
as if for an immortal moment, ecstatic morning of Harry
Garlett’s life.</p>

<p class='c008'>With no premonition of coming pain or evil Jean Bower’s
fortunate lover passed through the big paved courtyard
of the Etna China factory. He walked quickly into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>early Victorian marble-papered hall and so past the office
where sat two clerks, into the high square room which had
been for so long known to the good folk of Grendon as
“Mr. Dodson’s room.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His letters lay unopened on the shabby leather-covered
writing table, and as he sat down he saw that on the top
of the pile was an unstamped envelope marked “Private.”
Opening it, he read:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Red Lion, Grendon,</div>
      <div class='line in12'>December 17th.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>I propose to call on you to-morrow at eleven with regard to an
important matter. Will you please arrange to be in at that time?</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yours faithfully,</div>
      <div class='line in16'><span class='sc'>James Kentworthy</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>He stared down at the sheet of paper, trying to remember
if he had ever heard the name Kentworthy before. But
no, it meant nothing to him. Whoever this Kentworthy
might be he had no business to take it for granted that he,
Garlett, would be here, waiting his convenience, at eleven
o’clock!</p>

<p class='c008'>He got up and went into the outer office.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If a Mr. Kentworthy calls, I will see him. But say that
I can only spare him a few minutes, as I am very busy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As it was striking eleven, the door opened with: “Mr.
Kentworthy, sir,” and at once, with some surprise, Harry
Garlett recognized in his visitor a stranger he had seen walking
about Terriford village during the last week or so.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first time he, Garlett, had noticed him, this gray-haired
stout man had been standing in the road just outside the
gate of the Thatched House, chatting with one of the gardeners.
On another occasion he had seen the same person
looking at the inscriptions on the graves in the beautiful
churchyard, of which the high-banked wall bounded the top
of the broad village street. Also, this man whose name he
now knew to be Kentworthy had passed him more than once
on the narrow field path along which he had walked so
joyously this morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have only just read your note, Mr. Kentworthy, for I
was late this morning. What can I do for you? I’m afraid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>I cannot spare you much time, for, as you see, I haven’t even
opened my letters.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His burly, substantial-looking visitor came forward and
stood close to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I may take it that you’ve no idea of the business which
has brought me here, Mr. Garlett?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked straight into the face of the man he was addressing,
and Harry Garlett felt just a little disconcerted by
that steady, steely stare.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” he said frankly, “I have no idea at all of your business,
but I have lately seen you walking about Terriford
village, so I take it that you have some association with this
part of the world?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is my first visit to Grendon,” said the other slowly,
“and I was sent here, Mr. Garlett, on a most unpleasant
errand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again he looked searchingly at Garlett, and then he went
on, speaking in a deliberate, matter-of-fact voice:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am a police inspector attached to the Criminal Investigation
Department, and I was sent down here, about a week
ago, to make inquiries concerning the death of Mrs. Emily
Garlett, your late wife.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett got up from his chair; he was so bewildered,
so amazed, and yes, so dismayed, at what the other had just
said, that he wondered whether he could have heard those
strange, disturbing words aright.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Concerning the death of my wife?” he repeated. “I
don’t understand exactly what you mean by that——?”</p>

<p class='c008'>James Kentworthy did not take his eyes off the other’s
face. Long and successful as had been his career in the
Criminal Investigation Department, he had never had a case
of which the opening moves interested and, in a sense, puzzled
him so much as did this case. He asked himself
whether the man now standing opposite to him, whose face
had gone gray under its healthy tan, was an innocent man,
or that most dangerous and vile of criminals, a secret poisoner?</p>

<p class='c008'>“From some information recently laid before the Home
Office, it seems desirable that the cause of Mrs. Garlett’s
death should be fully ascertained,” he said slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett sat down again.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“On whose information are you acting?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That, for obvious reasons, we are not prepared to divulge,”
answered the other coldly. And he also sat down.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett’s mind was darting hither and thither.
Curse the gossips of Terriford! He had known them to
create much smoke where he had felt convinced there was no
fire—but never, never so noisome a smoke as this.</p>

<p class='c008'>His heart became suddenly full of Jean—his darling, innocent
little love. Such a child, too, as regarded the evil
side of human nature, with all her common sense and practical
cleverness. The thought of Jean almost unmanned
him, but, in a flash, he realized that if only for her sake
he must face this odious inquiry with courage and frankness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it you desire to know concerning my late wife’s
death?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Although Mrs. Garlett’s death was exceedingly sudden,
there does not seem to have been any question of an inquest,”
observed the man Garlett now knew to represent all
the formidable and mysterious powers of the C.I.D.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There was not the slightest necessity for an inquest,”
was the quiet answer. “Dr. Maclean, who had been my
wife’s medical attendant for many years, saw her the day
before she died.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Kentworthy took a thick, small, notebook out of his
coat pocket, and opening it, began reading it to himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am aware of that fact,” he said, without looking up,
“and of course my next step will be to call on Dr. Maclean.
But before doing that I thought it only fair to come and tell
you of my inquiries, Mr. Garlett.” He looked up. “Have
you any objection to giving me an account of your wife’s
death—as far as you can remember the circumstances? Let
me see—it’s only seven months ago, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again Harry Garlett made a mighty effort to pull himself
together. He had all your honest man’s instinctive, absolute
trust in justice. No one believed more firmly than
himself that “truth will out, even in an affidavit,” but even
so, though he was not exactly an imaginative man, he did
feel as if the gods, envious of the wonderful happiness with
which his cup had been filled up to brimming over till a few
moments ago, had devised this cruel, devilish trick....</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“I am quite willing to tell you everything you wish to
know,” he said frankly. “But there is very little to tell,
Mr. Kentworthy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is a fact, is it not, that your wife was a lady of considerable
means, and that she gave over to you the greater
part of her fortune quite early in your married life?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Garlett flushed. “That is so. But I beg you to believe
that that was by no wish of mine. In fact, as I can prove
to you, I remade my will at once, leaving the money back to
her in case I predeceased her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>James Kentworthy smiled. In spite of himself he was
beginning to like Harry Garlett, and even to feel inclined to
believe, to hope, he had been sent to this sleepy, old-world
country town on a wild-goose chase.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here!” he exclaimed, “I don’t want you to be on
the defensive with me, Mr. Garlett. If, as I trust will be the
case, these inquiries of mine show that everything occurred
in—well, in a regular and proper manner, no one will be
more pleased than I shall be. I am not trying to catch you
out in any way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Garlett’s face lightened. “Thank you for saying that.
But—but I feel so bewildered, Mr. Kentworthy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understand that. Still, in your own interest I beg you
to tell me, as clearly as possible, whatever details you may
remember as to your wife’s sudden death. I propose to
make a shorthand note of all you say, and then, after I have
transcribed it, to ask you to read it over and sign the statement.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He waited a moment, then added:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I need hardly say that if you would prefer to ask your
solicitor to be present, I shall raise no objection.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I would far rather say the little I have to say to you
alone,” exclaimed Harry Garlett eagerly. “I have a very
strong reason for hoping that the matter will never be known
to any one but to us two—and, I suppose I must add, to Dr.
Maclean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I shall have to see Dr. Maclean,” answered
the police inspector. “But now, Mr. Garlett, go ahead!
I would, however, suggest that you give orders that we be
not interrupted. A great deal depends on your statement,
as well as on that of Mrs. Garlett’s medical attendant. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>they both prove satisfactory, the Home Office will not issue
what it is always reluctant to do—an exhumation order.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“An exhumation order?”</p>

<p class='c008'>As he repeated those ominous words, there was a tone of
utter dismay and horror in Harry Garlett’s voice, and the
older man threw him a quick, suspicious glance. Why did
the suggestion of an exhumation order cause Emily Garlett’s
widower such unease? Then he reminded himself that,
after all, an absolutely innocent man might well quail before
an ordeal which, whatever the precautions taken, was bound
to become public.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That would obviously be the next step,” he said reluctantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett took up the telephone receiver which stood
on his writing-table. “I am not to be disturbed on any
account,” he called through.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, settling himself squarely in his chair, he faced
his tormentor:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ask me any questions you like, Mr. Kentworthy,” he
said, “and I promise to answer them fully and truthfully.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The police inspector moved his chair a little nearer to the
writing-table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understand, from the few inquiries I have been able
to make, that Mrs. Garlett was always in delicate health?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is so; indeed my wife may be said to have been
born delicate. She told me once that she never remembered
feeling really well. Her parents made a very late marriage,
and she was an only child.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She was a good deal older than you were, was she not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett reddened. The fact had always been a
sensitive point with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was twenty-two when I married, and my wife, at
twenty-seven, seemed in my eyes still quite a young woman.
She was very slender, and, at that time of her life, did not
look more than twenty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I suppose I may assume that it was a marriage of
affection on both sides?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A deeper flush came over Harry Garlett’s face. Though
he had an open, cheery manner, he was in some ways a very
reserved man. It was, therefore, with obvious, though restrained,
emotion that he answered, in a low voice:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“My mother died when I was a child, and I had no sister.
My father failed in business when I was a lad of fourteen,
and a godfather paid for my later education. Until I came
to Grendon I had hardly ever spoken to a young lady of refinement.
At once the Thatched House became to me what
I had never known, a home, and its young mistress my—my
ideal of womanhood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see,” said the other man, touched by the candid admissions.
“Then I take it, Mr. Garlett, that yours was a
love marriage?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In spite of my wife’s ill-health, and our disappointment
at not having children, I doubt if any married folk ever led a
happier and more placid existence than we did—till the war,”
answered Harry Garlett earnestly, but, as the other thought,
a little evasively.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My wife took the greatest pride and pleasure in my success
as a cricketer. Yet she was so far from strong that,
even in the old days, she could seldom sit out a match.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know that you were the third man in Terriford to join up
in August, ’14,” observed Mr. Kentworthy, “but that, I take
it, did not mean that you were not completely happy at home?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed, it did not! I felt that every fit man, in a position
to do so, ought to join up at once. As for my wife, she
was one of those old-fashioned women who approve of
everything their husbands do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very few of that sort about now,” said Mr. Kentworthy,
smiling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, my wife was one of those few! I told her how I
felt about it all, and she said no word to stop me. And yet
I have every reason to believe that she went through a real
martyrdom while I was at the front——” He waited a
moment, then concluded: “And when the war came to an
end, and I settled down at home again, I realized that she
had become a permanent invalid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A terrible thing for a man of your age,” observed Mr.
Kentworthy thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett made no answer to that comment. Had
he ever felt for poor Emily a tithe of what he now felt for
the girl who was to become his wife to-morrow, the condition
in which he had found her on his return home would indeed
have been a terrible thing. But with Emily, his relations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>though good, kindly, even in a sense, gratefully affectionate,
had not been such, even before the war, as greatly to affect
him. But that, after all, was entirely his own and most
secret business.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thank God—he was thinking of Jean now, not of Emily—he
had played fair in the great game of life. Tempted? Of
course he had been tempted. Once, at least, more fiercely
than he cared to remember now. But he had fought, beaten
down temptation, remaining not only in deed but even in
word, faithful to his marriage vow.</p>

<p class='c008'>He came back with something of a mental start to the
matter in hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was the first time he had ever spoken, in an intimate
sense, of his married life to any human being, and he was
surprised to feel that, instead of finding it difficult, it was,
in a sort of way, a relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>“People may have told you, Mr. Kentworthy, that my
wife was not a good-tempered woman,” he said earnestly,
“but all I can say is, she was the most devoted and generous-natured
of wives to me. I am aware that among my neighbours
I was criticized for being a good deal away from home.
No doubt I was selfish, absorbed in the game to which I give
so much of my life during the summer months, but it was
always with her eager encouragement that I went about and
lived the kind of life I did live.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mrs. Garlett must have been a most exceptional woman,”
said the other, and he spoke with no sarcastic intent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She came of a long line of high-minded, God-fearing
people—her old father was proud of the fact that he was
descended from a man who at one moment had been Cromwell’s
right hand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He, Harry Garlett, hadn’t thought of that for years. Yet,
what was perhaps more singular, poor Emily’s personality,
at once so commonplace and yet, in a sense, forceful, became
suddenly more present to him than it had ever been since
the last time they had talked together, on the evening of their
thirteenth wedding-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I may take it that there was never even a passing cloud
on your married life?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never a cloud!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett added impulsively, “I don’t want you to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>think me a better man than I am. I did not always find it an
easy situation——”</p>

<p class='c008'>The other cut him short: “I accept what you said just
now—that you two were happier, if anything, than the
average married couple?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I think we were—in fact, I’m sure we were.” He
spoke with sober decision.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, tell me something about last spring. Did you
think Mrs. Garlett more ailing than usual?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” said Garlett frankly, “I did not. She always made
an effort to appear bright during the comparatively short
times we were alone together, but, as I have already told you,
she had become a complete invalid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He went on in a rather lower tone: “I wonder if you
will understand when I tell you that she treated me, of late
years, more as a loving mother treats a dear son than as a
wife treats her husband——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Both men remained silent for a moment, and the police
inspector made a note in his book.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, concerning the night your wife died? I understand
the date was May the 28th, the time early on a Sunday
morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The 27th of May was the thirteenth anniversary of our
wedding-day,” began Harry Garlett. “And I’m ashamed
to say I had forgotten it. But my wife remembered. And
I found a gift, as a matter of fact, this gold cigarette case”—he
took a small plain gold case out of his pocket—“waiting
for me on my breakfast plate that Saturday morning. I
then altered a plan I had made for going away for the week-end,
and I decided to come home at one o’clock and spend as
much of the day as was possible with my wife.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You were not alone during that walk back to your house?”
suggested Mr. Kentworthy, in an indifferent tone. “You
were, I believe, with a young lady.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A young lady?” echoed Harry Garlett, surprised. “I
don’t think so.” And then suddenly he exclaimed: “You’re
quite right—but how very odd that any one should have
remembered it! I walked back with Miss Bower, the niece
of my wife’s medical attendant, Dr. Maclean. But she went
on to her home—she lives with the Macleans—and I had a
tray lunch upstairs, with my wife.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“Were you at home all that afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again it was as if Harry Garlett were making an effort to
remember.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think so,” he said slowly. “No, I’m wrong! I went
to a tennis party. My wife generally rested in the afternoon.
But I was back a little after six o’clock, and I sat
with her for some time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He knitted his brows, trying hard to remember what had
happened, and slowly half-forgotten incidents started into
life.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There was a question of some fruit, some forced strawberries
that a friend had brought that morning. The lady
who was then acting as our housekeeper and as my wife’s
nurse, thought I had given Mrs. Garlett the strawberries in
question. But that was a mistake. She certainly ate them,
so one of the maids must have given them to her. The matter
is of some moment, for, as Dr. Maclean will, I think, tell
you, it was this fruit which indirectly led to her death.
Strawberries generally disagreed with her, but she was very
fond of them, and as these were small Alpine strawberries
I suppose she thought it would be all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“When did you first become aware of your wife’s serious
condition?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It must have been about four o’clock in the morning
when Mrs. Garlett’s nurse-companion called me. She said
my wife was in great pain and had asked if she could have
some morphia. So I dressed and went at once for the doctor,
who lives about a quarter of a mile from my place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I had some trouble in rousing Dr. Maclean, but I think
we were back in my house well under half an hour——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Had Mrs. Garlett become worse?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My wife could not bear for me to see her in the sort of
state in which I understood she was then. So I waited
downstairs in my study, and about—well, I don’t think it
could have been more than twenty minutes after he had come
into the house, Dr. Maclean came down and broke to me the
fact that she was dead.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Had she died while you were fetching the doctor?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know—I don’t think so. I was terribly upset,
and I asked no questions. Though she was an invalid, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>always seemed, in a way, full of life—a steady, if a low,
flame. And she had seemed so well, so happy, that afternoon!
But wait a bit. I <i>have</i> forgotten something. My
wife had had a disagreeable shock. One of our servants
had admitted her sweetheart into the house the night before—as
a matter of fact into the drawing room, which has a
French window opening into the garden. Mrs. Garlett
heard sounds, and thought there were burglars in the house.
She actually went downstairs herself, and caught the girl red-handed,
as it were. I remember suggesting to Dr. Maclean
that the shock—for she was very particular about such things—might
have affected her heart. But he didn’t think so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He stopped speaking. Mr. Kentworthy was busily writing,
and Harry Garlett stared at his visitor’s bent head.
Though assuring himself that it would be “all right,” he felt
an eerie feeling of apprehension wrapping him round.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thank you for the straightforward way in which you
have answered my questions,” said the police inspector, getting
up from his chair, “and now I propose to see Dr. Maclean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Would you like me to make a telephone appointment
for you with him?” asked Garlett. “He’s a very busy man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, yes, I should. But I hope you won’t think it unreasonable
of me to ask you to give him no hint as to my
business?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will hear everything I say to him,” answered the
other quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>He took his telephone receiver off. “Put me through to
Dr. Maclean’s house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>James Kentworthy, who was now standing close to the
writing-table, heard the answer: “Miss Bower is already
on the line, sir; we told her you didn’t want to be disturbed—shall
I put her through?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, please.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, unmindful of the presence of a stranger, more
unmindful no doubt because James Kentworthy was still so
entirely a stranger to him, Harry Garlett put his whole heart
into the question he breathed into the receiver.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that you, my dearest?” And then—“I want to speak
to the doctor.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The other heard, as from afar off, a bright, happy voice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>exclaim: “He’s in the meadow with Aunt Jenny! I’ll run
along and get him. But you’d better hang up the receiver,
for I’m afraid it’ll be full five minutes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Garlett hung up the receiver, and again faced his visitor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should like to tell you, Mr. Kentworthy, that I am just
about to be married.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just about to be married?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The police inspector wondered if he had kept out of his
voice, not only the surprise, but the dismay which he felt at
this to him astounding disclosure.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My fiancée is the niece of Dr. Maclean. She was on the
telephone just now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The young lady who, for a while, was your secretary?”</p>

<p class='c008'>In spite of himself, there was a note of deep disappointment
in the voice in which Mr. Kentworthy asked the
question.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett instinctively straightened himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Bower became secretary to the Etna China Company—not
my personal secretary—just before my wife’s
death.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was an awkward silence between the two men.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see,” said Mr. Kentworthy at last. “I see, Mr. Garlett.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But, as a matter of fact, he felt as if he had walked from
the bright sunshine into an evil-smelling fog. Quite a number
of pages in his thick little notebook bore the heading
“Miss Jean Bower.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is the date of your wedding fixed?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, yes, it is.” Harry Garlett hesitated, then exclaimed
impulsively—“We are to be married to-morrow morning, by
special license! No one, however, knows that fact excepting
the vicar and his wife, and, of course, Dr. and Mrs. Maclean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again there followed a strange, painful silence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I take it you will postpone your marriage till this matter
is thoroughly cleared up?” said the police inspector at last.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the younger man, dismayed, made no immediate answer,
the other added: “<i>I</i> should do so, in your place, Mr.
Garlett.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Before he could speak the telephone bell rang and Harry
Garlett took up the receiver and in a falsely cheerful tone—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>tone with which, alas, James Kentworthy was painfully
familiar as a result of his life work—he called out: “Is that
you, Dr. Maclean? Garlett speaking. Would you be in if
Mr. Kentworthy, a gentleman who wants to see you, on
urgent private business, were to come along now? Yes?
Right!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He hung up the receiver. “Dr. Maclean will see you at
once.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Both men got up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One word before you go, Mr. Kentworthy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Mr. Garlett?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Try as he might, he could not bring back the kindly tone
into which he felt he had been betrayed during the latter part
of their conversation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose the only thing that would set the matter absolutely
at rest would be the exhumation of my wife’s body?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is so—obviously,” answered the other, briefly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Within an hour of his having left the Etna factory,
James Kentworthy got up from his chair in Dr. Maclean’s
consulting room.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man who had come down to Terriford to make these
delicate inquiries was honest and conscientious, set on finding
out the truth and nothing but the truth. Also, this was to
be his last official investigation, and he had every reason for
hoping that it would be a short business. The moment it
was over he was to retire from the service and start for himself
as a private inquiry agent. He was, therefore, sincerely
glad that the conversation he had had with the late Mrs. Garlett’s
medical man had been, from his point of view, thoroughly
satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the first few minutes of his interview with Mr.
Kentworthy, Dr. Maclean had been so indignant and so
shocked when he realized his visitor’s business, that he had
been very unwilling to give the police inspector any information.
But he had soon realized that this was a mistake on
his part, and by the end of their conversation the two men
were on excellent terms the one with the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now that their long talk was, as they both thought,
drawing to an end, Dr. Maclean said earnestly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do hope, Mr. Kentworthy, that I have been able to
convince you not only that Mrs. Garlett died a natural death,
but that my friend Garlett himself was for long years an
exceptionally good husband to the poor, sickly woman?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have convinced me,” said the inspector frankly,
“that Mrs. Garlett’s death was almost certainly a natural
death. But I cannot pledge my superiors in any way, and
the best thing would be for you to come with me to London
to-night and see the gentleman in charge of the case to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean stood up.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“There’s one more thing I feel you should know, though it
has nothing directly to do with the matter in hand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Kentworthy stiffened into quick attention.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My wife’s niece, Jean Bower, is just about to be married
to Harry Garlett. As a matter of fact, the wedding has been
fixed to take place to-morrow——”</p>

<p class='c008'>A quick inward debate took place in the Inspector’s mind.
Should he imitate the other’s frankness? He made up his
mind that it was his duty to do so.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am aware of that, Dr. Maclean, for Mr. Garlett told me
the fact himself. I hope you won’t be offended when I say
that I regret very much that he did not wait a little longer.
After all, it’s a very short time since Mrs. Garlett’s death.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She died in May, and we are now in December!” exclaimed
the doctor with some heat. “And remember—I
speak as from man to man—that the woman had been Garlett’s
wife only in name for many a long year.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do remember that,” said James Kentworthy slowly.
“But ask yourself, Dr. Maclean, how so quick a second marriage
would strike ordinary people—who knew nothing of
the special circumstances of the case?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But every one here, in this neighbourhood, does know
the circumstances,” objected the doctor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Each word this stranger had uttered in the last few moments
had been said again and again in the last month by
Dr. Maclean to his wife. But he was not going to admit
anything of the sort now, even to himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hardly knowing what he was doing he sat down again,
and Mr. Kentworthy did the same.</p>

<p class='c008'>Leaning forward, the police inspector said earnestly: “You
must remember, sir, that what we, in our line of inquiry,
are always looking for, is—motive.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Motive?” repeated the doctor. “I don’t quite follow
what you mean, Mr. Kentworthy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I need not tell you—a doctor—that in the vast majority of
cases the death of a man or woman is always of interest, and
very often of considerable benefit, to some human being?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see your point,” said the other uneasily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In this case,” went on Mr. Kentworthy, “I soon realized
that money had played no part at all in the matter I had been
sent to investigate.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>He stopped abruptly, hardly knowing how to frame the
unpleasant fact he wanted to convey.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last he said frankly: “You must admit, doctor, that
Mrs. Garlett’s death released her husband from a very trying
position. It made him a free man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s true. Yet I ask you to believe me, Mr. Kentworthy,
when I tell you most solemnly that Harry Garlett
never longed, even unconsciously, for that sort of freedom.
He is a man’s man in daily life; he never seemed in the least
interested in women; and there was never the slightest
breath of scandal about his name.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The police inspector looked at him gravely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am sorry to say that you are mistaken, Dr. Maclean.
You are evidently not aware that there has been a great deal
of gossip, not only since Mrs. Garlett’s death, but even before
her death, concerning Mr. Garlett and the young lady to
whom he is now engaged.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean jumped up from his chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I deny that! I deny it absolutely!”</p>

<p class='c008'>His eyes flashed, he struck his writing-table with his hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What devils some women are! Why, my poor little
niece had only just become secretary to the Etna Company
when Mrs. Garlett died——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She took over her new duties on the 26th of last April,”
observed the inspector quietly, “and, from what I can make
out, there seems no doubt that Mr. Garlett, who up to then
had much neglected his duties as managing director, leaving
everything, it appears, to his partner, a certain Mr. Jabez
Dodson, began going daily to the Etna China factory.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean sat down again. He felt far more disturbed
than he would have cared to acknowledge, even to himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose,” he said slowly, “that it would not be fair to
ask you the source of this absolutely untrue and poisonous
gossip?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t say it would be unfair—but I am sure you will
understand that it would not be right of me to oblige
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you mind telling me exactly what it is you have heard?—narrowing
down the point to what you have been told
happened before Mrs. Garlett’s death?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Kentworthy began to feel sorry he had said anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>about that side of his investigations. He had been tempted
into indiscretion by his liking for this man, and his growing
conviction that Harry Garlett’s wife had died an absolutely
natural death.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was as a friend of these foolish, if honest, people that
he had just said what he knew was true. After all, it was
perhaps just as well that they should know the kind of gossip
floating about.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The most serious thing I have heard,” he said quietly,
“is that your niece and Mr. Garlett occasionally met secretly,
late at night, in a little wood which forms part of Mr. Garlett’s
property.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean stared at the speaker with growing anger and
astonishment, and the other, pursuing his advantage, as even
the kindest men are sometimes tempted to do, went on—</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have actually spoken to the person who saw them there
on at least two occasions.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again Dr. Maclean got up. “You have actually found a
man or woman who declares that he or she saw my niece,
Jean Bower, and Harry Garlett, under the compromising
circumstances you have described?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” exclaimed the other quickly. “I cannot say that
the person in question mentioned Miss Bower. What she
said—I admit it is a woman—was that she had twice seen
Mr. Garlett and a young lady in the wood forming part of the
Thatched House property, and that, on the second occasion,
she overheard something like an altercation between the
two. Garlett’s companion burst into tears and reproached
him, from what I can make out, for his coldness to her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good God!” exclaimed Dr. Maclean.</p>

<p class='c008'>He sat down again, heavily. He felt suddenly years older.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Having said so much, I think it is only fair to you to
read the exact words I put down after seeing the young
woman in question.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Young</i> woman? Then the author of this infamous lie
is not Miss Prince?” said the doctor to himself as he listened
to the inspector beginning to read from his notebook.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was one day late in April, I cannot fix the date. When I
got to the little wood I saw Mr. Garlett and a young lady walking
down the path. I did not want them to see me, so I hid behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>some laurels. I think from what I could make out, they were
talking about the war. There was no love-making that I could see.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must understand,” explained Mr. Kentworthy,
looking up, “that the person in question did not give me
this connected account that I have read out. I had more
or less to drag out of her these apparently unimportant
details.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is nothing there about a quarrel or tears,” observed
the doctor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We are coming to that,” said the other quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It must have been exactly a week later,” he read on, “that I
was there again. I wondered if I should see them, and sure enough
I did! It was a moonlit night, so I could see their figures clearly.
I couldn’t hear much of what they were saying, for I was afraid of
going too near, owing to its being so much more light than it had
been the time before, but I did hear Mr. Garlett speaking as if he
thought it was wrong of them to be there together at all. He begged
the lady’s pardon ever so many times, and seemed a good deal distressed.
As for her, she was sobbing bitterly, and kept saying, ‘I
am very tired, or I shouldn’t be upset like this.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I may as well read you the impression the story made
on me at the time,” said Mr. Kentworthy, and he went on
with his notebook:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I pressed her again and again to give me some indication of who
the young lady was. I cannot believe her assertion that it was a
stranger to her. But she persisted in her statement that though she
knew the man was Garlett she did not know his companion. If this
is true it follows that Garlett’s companion was some woman who
had come out either from Grendon or perhaps from an even greater
distance to spend an hour with him. Note: Make inquiries as to
how he spent his time, and with whom, during his frequent absences
from home before his wife’s death.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You cannot be surprised,” he added looking up, “that
I feel everything points to Mr. Garlett’s companion in the
wood having been the young lady with whom he is now on
the eve of marriage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose I can’t expect you to agree with me,” said Dr.
Maclean, “when I say that I am convinced that the story
is entirely false from beginning to end. I <i>know</i> my niece
never met Harry Garlett secretly at night, or, for the matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>of that, in the daytime. Only his own admission would
make me believe that Garlett met any woman in such compromising
and dangerous circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Kentworthy remained silent. It was clear he did not
accept the other man’s view of the story.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly the doctor pressed the electric bell on his table,
twice, sharply: “I’m going to send for my niece,” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Kentworthy started up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s not fair,” he cried. “That’s not playing the
game!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bide a wee, man. I’m not going to do anything unfair.
I simply want you to see the child. I’ll give her a message
for my wife.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A moment later the door opened and Jean Bower ran in.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Uncle Jock? What——” and then she stopped
short. “I beg your pardon. I did not know you had any
one here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Kentworthy—my niece.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The two shook hands, and as he looked keenly into her
fresh guileless face and noted, as only a trained eye would
have done, the dozen little details which go to differentiate
one type of modern girl from the other, James Kentworthy
told himself that Dr. Maclean had shown a sure instinct in
thus obliging him to see Harry Garlett’s betrothed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The experienced police inspector was not a susceptible
man, and he was one whose work habitually caused him to
see the ugliest side of feminine human nature. Yet he would
have staked a great deal on the probability that the girl now
before him was as pure and essentially simple-hearted as
had been the mother whose memory he cherished. He made
up his mind that Harry Garlett’s mysterious companion had
almost certainly not been this young woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want you to tell your aunt, my dear, that I have unexpectedly
got to go to town to-night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Jock!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean looked very troubled and dismayed. “I’d better
’phone to Harry at once, hadn’t I?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, do, my dear. But first tell your aunt. She’d better
send a note to the vicar—that is if you want me to be
present at your wedding.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>She reddened deeply. How very strange and odd of
Uncle Jock to speak of to-morrow’s secret ceremony before
a stranger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course we want you to be there. Why, we shouldn’t
feel married if you weren’t there! We’ll put the wedding
off for a day or two.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She tried to speak lightly and, turning, left the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There!” exclaimed Dr. Maclean. “D’you see that girl
meeting a married man in a wood at night? She’s the most
self-possessed, dignified little lassie I’ve ever met! Not that
she is lacking in feeling. She’s devoted <i>now</i>, to that man,
and,” he went on, speaking with a good deal of emotion,
“I hope to God she will never know of this horrible, if it was
not so serious I should say this ridiculous, business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly the telephone bell on his table rang. He took
up the receiver.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I said I was not to be disturbed”—and then in a very
different voice—“Garlett?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Has the man who called on me this morning gone? I
feel I must see you.... Yes, I’m still at the office.
Where else should I be?... Somehow the horror of it
all seems to grow and grow on me.... For the first
time in my life I feel as if I don’t know what I ought to do!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor felt dismayed. It was clear that the invisible
speaker was painfully excited and overwrought.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think there’s anything to worry about,” he called
back soothingly. “My interview with Mr. Kentworthy has
been quite satisfactory, and I’m going up to London to-night
to see the people concerned to-morrow morning. Best not
say too much over the telephone, my dear fellow. Bad
breaks will come in business, as we all know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He hung up the receiver.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Garlett’s thoroughly rattled!” he exclaimed. “D’you see
any objection to his coming up with us to-night and going
to the Home Office to-morrow morning?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The other hesitated.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Frankly, I shouldn’t advise that. If you, as Mrs. Garlett’s
medical attendant, can convince my chiefs that she
died a natural death, the whole matter will be dropped.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understand that, and I’ll make him follow your advice,”
said the doctor. “But what I can’t make out—what I would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>give a good deal to know—I suppose you know and won’t
tell me?—is what started this damnable inquiry?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The eyes of the two men crossed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There are such things as anonymous letters,” observed
Mr. Kentworthy dryly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anonymous letters?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Surprised though he felt, he told himself that he had been
a fool not to think of that solution of the mystery.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t know,” he muttered, “that poor Garlett had an
enemy in the world. But I suppose you can’t run any
business without making some bad blood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose you can’t,” agreed the other. “But one thing
I will tell you. The letters in question were never written
by a factory hand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He leant forward and instinctively lowering his voice, he
went on:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you think of any one who bears Mr. Garlett a
grudge? Having said so much I think I may go a step
further and say that we have no doubt at all that it is a
woman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A woman?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again the doctor’s suspicions swung around to Miss
Prince.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understand that before his wife’s death Mr. Garlett
went about a great deal?” went on the other thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s true. Garlett’s a very good fellow, and very
popular. As a famous cricketer he knew people more or
less all over England, and the only kind of business he really
did for the Etna China works was that of sometimes acting
as a sort of glorified commercial traveller.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That being so, Dr. Maclean, don’t you think it possible
that he may have formed some kind of connection which he
gave up as, queerly enough, a good many men do give up
such friendships after a wife’s death?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In this strange world of ours,” said the doctor reluctantly,
“everything is possible. But I would have staked a good
deal that that particular thing was never true of Harry
Garlett. I take it you have seen the anonymous letters in
question?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The police inspector quietly opened his black attaché case.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see no reason why I should not show the letters to you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>now!” he exclaimed. “I feel certain the originals will be
submitted for your inspection at the Home Office. I, of
course, have only a set of facsimiles.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor’s face, which had been very grave, livened into
eager curiosity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Kentworthy came up to the writing table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This was the first letter. It was not addressed to the
Home Office. It was sent to Scotland Yard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>While he was speaking he had put his hand over the sheet
of paper; now he lifted it, and Dr. Maclean saw a large sheet
of paper marked I. Drawn in pencil was a curious conventional
design, under which ran the words—“Water-mark
of the original (foreign) paper.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, written in block letters in very black ink, he read the
following:</p>

<p class='c010'>THE WRITER FEELS IT HIS DUTY TO DRAW THE ATTENTION
OF THE HEAD COMMISSIONER OF POLICE TO
CERTAIN MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING
THE DEATH, ON THE 28TH OF LAST MAY, OF MRS. EMILY
GARLETT AT THE THATCHED HOUSE, TERRIFORD VILLAGE.
MRS. GARLETT WAS THE WIFE OF HENRY GARLETT,
OWNER AND MANAGING-DIRECTOR OF THE WELL-KNOWN
GRENDON ETNA CHINA FACTORY. THOUGH THE DEATH
WAS VERY SUDDEN, NO INQUEST WAS HELD.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This reads like a man’s letter,” observed Dr. Maclean.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was meant to read like a man’s letter,” said Mr. Kentworthy.
“But we believe it to be the work of an educated
woman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor went on staring at the sinister epistle. What
dread secret of love or hate—or was it only poisonous malice—lay
behind these roughly ink-printed words?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here is the envelope. You will notice that the postmark,
which by the way has been drawn in, for it was too
obliterated for any other method to be of use, shows the
letter to have been posted in London just a month ago. For
what it is worth I may remind you that almost any educated
man would realize that such a communication should be sent
to the Criminal Investigation Department of the Home Office,
and not to Scotland Yard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What happens,” asked Dr. Maclean, “when such a thing
as this is received?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“By long experience we are well aware that such a letter
is likely to be only one of a series—and sure enough, four
days later, came this second letter!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The speaker pushed aside the first sheet of paper he had
laid down, and put in its place another.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This surely is from an uneducated person?” exclaimed
Dr. Maclean.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was now gazing at a most peculiar looking script,
marked 2.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not necessarily,” said Mr. Kentworthy. “But whether
written by the same individual or not, this was undoubtedly
written with the left hand. It is extremely difficult for any
handwriting expert, however clever, to identify a letter
written with the left hand with the writer’s ordinary right-hand
script. There are as a rule certain similarities, but
those proceed from the brain rather than from the mechanical
action of the hand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think I understand what you mean,” and, bending down,
he read the following long comma-less sentence:</p>

<p class='c010'>It’s a shame the police took no notice of what happened at The
Thatched House when poor Mrs. Garlett died she died in agony her
husband was carrying on at the time with more than one girl the
doctor’s niece could tell you why poor Mrs. Garlett’s doctor made no
fuss people have asked why no inquest echo answers why?</p>

<p class='c008'>“What an abominable thing!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean’s eyes flamed with anger. “I hope to God
that neither my niece nor Harry Garlett will ever see this
vulgar, hateful letter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can reassure you on that point,” said the other earnestly.
“Under no consideration are these kinds of communications
brought into a law case,” and, as he saw a shadow pass over
the doctor’s face:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not that I think there will be a law case. Since my talk
with Mr. Garlett this morning, and with you during the
last hour, I believe that all this trouble has been caused by
some hysterical woman who has a grudge against Mr. Garlett.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean muttered: “I only wish I had the writer of
this letter here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps you’d rather not see the other letter?” said his
visitor, half smiling.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Human nature was always surprising James Kentworthy,
and now he was amused in spite of himself. Dr. Maclean
had taken the first anonymous letter calmly, but the moment
he himself had been brought into the matter he had evidently
felt very differently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I’d rather see it!” he exclaimed brusquely, and
the police inspector put it down before him.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 3 was written in block letters.</p>

<p class='c010'>THE WRITER OF THE LETTER DATED NOVEMBER 25TH
ADVISES THE HEAD COMMISSIONER OF POLICE TO ASK
MR. HENRY GARLETT TO RENDER A FULL ACCOUNT OF
THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING HIS WIFE’S DEATH.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think,” said Dr. Maclean hesitatingly, “that I know
who wrote two of those letters.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You do?” Mr. Kentworthy leaped to his feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suspect,” said the doctor, “that the writer is a certain
Mary Prince, the daughter, I am sorry to say, of the medical
man from whom I bought my practice.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The lady who lives at the Thatched Cottage?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Kentworthy felt sadly disappointed. He was convinced
the doctor was on a wrong track.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I feel sure it is she,” Dr. Maclean spoke with growing
energy and conviction. “Miss Prince is a most malicious
woman. She has never liked Harry Garlett, and I know she
has been genuinely shocked at his thought of remarriage.
She actually guessed how things were between him and my
poor little niece before they knew it themselves.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Believe me, you are on the wrong track, Dr. Maclean.
I had a talk with this very lady two days ago, and though I
don’t think she has a pleasant disposition, if she is really the
writer of these letters then she entirely took <i>me</i> in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did she know why you were here?” asked Dr. Maclean.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good heavens, no! I hope you won’t be shocked when I
confess that I told her I was distantly related, through her
mother, to the late Mrs. Garlett. On the strength of this
statement she asked me to tea, and we had a long talk. She
is a shrewd, clever woman, though I admit a dangerous
gossip. By the way, there is one person who, I gather, was
actually with Mrs. Garlett when she died. I mean a certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Miss Agatha Cheale, who is a friend of this Miss Prince.
How about her, Dr. Maclean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Unconsciously the doctor stiffened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know that there is anything to say about Miss
Cheale. She was distantly related to the Garletts. Mrs.
Garlett’s death was a real misfortune for her, for although
the poor lady left her a thousand pounds, she was actually
receiving a salary of three hundred pounds a year.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“When was she here last?” asked Mr. Kentworthy suddenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She came down for a week-end visit to Miss Prince about
a month ago, and I think she is coming for Christmas. A
capable, intelligent young woman, but I don’t think she could
add anything to what I have told you—the more so, that
although she was in a war hospital in France, she is not a
trained nurse.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’ll be going now. Shall we meet at Grendon
station at five o’clock and travel together?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“By all means.” The two men shook hands cordially.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope you will be able to forget all about this business
after to-morrow,” said the police inspector earnestly.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>But Dr. Maclean felt very sick at heart when he finally
shut the door on his unwelcome visitor, and turned his steps
reluctantly toward the dining room where he knew his wife,
and probably Jean with her, was likely to be.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he opened the dining-room door he saw with relief that
Mrs. Maclean was alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What signifies the message Jean brought me just now?”
she exclaimed. “Why must the marriage be put off, even
for one day, Jock? Surely you can postpone going to
London till to-morrow afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m the bearer of bad news,” he said heavily.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Maclean stood up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter?” she asked in a frightened tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>As her husband remained silent, she went up to him, and
gave his arm a shake:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jock? You’re frightening me! Have you found out
anything about Harry Garlett? D’you mean you think the
marriage will have to be broken off?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She added, “The child’s fair daft about him!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“There’s no question of breaking off the marriage,” he
said quickly. “In fact, if I had my way Jean should not be
told anything—beyond the bare fact that her wedding must
be postponed for a day or two.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, before he could say anything further, the door
behind them burst open and Harry Garlett rushed into the
room.</p>

<p class='c008'>His face was drawn and haggard—he looked years older
than he had done that morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hoped to catch that London detective here—but I hear
he’s gone. Look here, Maclean. I’ve had time to think
over what I ought to do, and I’ve decided to go to London
at once and clear the matter up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What matter have you to clear up?” asked Mrs. Maclean.</p>

<p class='c008'>Garlett walked straight over to where she was standing
and looked at her fixedly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am suspected of having murdered my wife, Aunt
Jenny,” he said in a hard, matter-of-fact voice, “and from
what I can make out that suspicion will never be laid to rest
till they have dug up the poor creature and satisfied themselves
that she died a natural death.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The colour drifted from Mrs. Maclean’s healthy face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is what he says true?” she asked, turning to her husband.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes and no,” he answered in a measured tone. “It’s
true that Harry has some deadly enemy who is trying to
fasten this awful charge on him. But my talk just now with
a man named Kentworthy who was sent down from the
Home Office——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Home Office?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Maclean was an intelligent woman, and the words
struck a note of sharp fear in her breast.</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor went on: “I’ve just had the fellow here for
over an hour, and I think I’ve convinced him that the—well,
the suspicion, if you can go so far as to call it that, is absolutely
groundless.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett broke in: “But did Kentworthy tell you
what I forced him to admit to me—that nothing short of an
exhumation will really settle the matter, and that unless that
takes place the matter may be raised again at any time?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A tide of dismay welled up in Dr. Maclean’s heart. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>suddenly realized that what this wild-eyed man, who looked
so little like the happy, still young lover of this morning, was
saying, was only too true.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even so he forced himself to exclaim: “You take an exaggerated
view, Harry. All I ask you to do is to await the
result of my interview with the Home Office people.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett was staring at the speaker, a look of terrible
perplexity as well as acute suffering on his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In any case, I suppose you would admit that our marriage
will have to be postponed?” he said slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, yes, I’m afraid it must be—for a day or two.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Mrs. Maclean broke in:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Before you even decide on that I think you ought to
consult Jean. After all, she’s the person most nearly concerned,
isn’t she? Though perhaps—” she hesitated painfully,
“we need not tell her the reason for the postponement?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Garlett turned away and stared out into the wintry garden,
and there was such a look of anguish on his face that Mrs.
Maclean suddenly felt a rush of intense, overwhelming pity
for him.</p>

<p class='c008'>She went across to where he was standing and put her
hand gently on his arm. But he made no response.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean cleared his throat: “Perhaps I’d better go
and tell Jean what has happened? I don’t see how we can
hope to keep it from her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the unhappy man roused himself: “No!” he said
violently, “I’ll tell her myself—I’d rather she heard it from
me.</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned to the doctor. “I know how kind you are——”
his voice broke, “but I feel that she ought to hear this vile
thing from me——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think that’s true, Jock,” said Mrs. Maclean quietly.
“So now I’ll go and find the child.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was walking to the door when Garlett asked suddenly:
“Where is Jean? Out of doors? I’d rather speak to her
there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll see you’re not disturbed.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Jean Bower was already on her way back to the house
when Harry Garlett caught sight of her. She was walking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>quickly, her whole figure instinct with the joyous buoyancy
and grace of happy youth.</p>

<p class='c008'>When she saw her lover she stopped short, pleased and yet
surprised, for he had told her that he was not coming back
from the factory till late afternoon.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, as he hurried up to her, there swept over her
a feeling of sharp misgiving.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is anything the matter?” she asked affrightedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>He took hold of her arm and guided her to a brick path
which was now, to them both, filled with delicious associations,
for it was here that they had always come, during
the few short weeks of their secret engagement, to be alone
together. Closed in on either side by old yew hedges, it was
the only part of the Bonnie Doon garden really sheltered
from prying eyes. Often, nay almost always, their first,
their only, kisses, on any given day, were taken and given
here, between those high, impenetrable walls of living green.
To Jean the yew hedge walk had become holy ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so, as they turned the corner, the girl’s heart began
to beat quickly. Here it was that Harry always turned
with a sudden, passionate movement, and took her in his
arms. But to-day her lover hurried her along the uneven
brick path until they reached the extreme end of the shadowed
walk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, and not till then, he stopped, and faced her with the
words: “We can’t be married to-morrow——”</p>

<p class='c008'>He had meant to add, “I am suspected of having poisoned
my wife.” But he found he could not utter the hateful
words. They would not come.</p>

<p class='c008'>And Jean? Gazing up into his haggard face she felt a
mingled rush of intense relief and deep, exultant love and
tenderness. It moved her to the soul to think that the
postponement of their marriage could make him look as he
was looking now. But she was quickly, painfully, undeceived.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A man came to see me at the works this morning to tell
me that there seems to be some doubt as to the cause of
Emily’s death.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her face filled with deep surprise and dismay, but no
suspicion of what his words implied crossed her mind. All
she did understand was that what had happened had given
this man who was so entirely her own, a terrible shock.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“Why should that make any difference to our being married
to-morrow morning?” she asked in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because neither your aunt nor your uncle would wish
you to be married to a man suspected of murder.” He
spoke with harsh directness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Murder?” Jean Bower’s eyes flashed. She did not
shrink, as he had thought she would do; instead she threw
herself on his breast and pressed close up to him, putting her
arms round his neck.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If that is true, but I don’t believe it is true, then I want
to marry you at once—to-day rather than to-morrow, Harry.
Oh, my love, my own dear love, don’t look at me like that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>His arms hungrily enfolded her, but he shook his head
determinedly. “Till the whole thing is cleared up, we’ve
got to face this trouble separately.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No! No! <i>No!</i>” she exclaimed, looking up eagerly,
piteously, into his drawn face. “Not separately, but together,
Harry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And it was he, not she, who broke down as she pressed
up closer to him, for, to her agonized distress, he pushed her
away and broke into short, gasping, hard sobs.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t come back to the house,” he said at last. “Tell
your uncle I’ll meet him at the station, my darling.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She saw he was making a great effort over himself, and
very gallantly she “played up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, I’ll tell him. But Harry?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes?” he said listlessly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll go now and get something to eat. Promise?” and
for the first time her lips quivered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I promise.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again he took her in his arms. Their lips met and clung
together. At last, “Oh, Jean,” he whispered brokenly, “do
you think we shall ever be happy again?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course we shall,” she said confidently.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then she walked with him through the wintry, bare
garden to the field where there was a gate which gave into
the road leading to Grendon. There they did not kiss again.
They only shook hands quietly.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The scene shifts to London—London, so indifferent, so
cruel, so drab a city to those whom she is stranger,
not mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett and Dr. Maclean had gone to a city hotel
where they felt sure that they would run little risk of meeting
any one from their part of the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>And it was there, within sound of what he vaguely felt to
be the comforting roar of London’s busiest traffic, that Garlett
paced up and down a big private sitting room in the
cold, foggy atmosphere of a December afternoon, while he
waited for the doctor’s return from the Criminal Investigation
Department of the Home Office.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last he stopped and looked at his watch. But for
the cruel man or woman who had written the anonymous
letters of which Dr. Maclean had told him, he and Jean
would by now have been man and wife. He reminded himself
drearily that he had forgotten to cancel his order for the
small suite of rooms overlooking the Thames where they
were to have spent their Christmas honeymoon. Well, so
much the better! It gave him a little satisfaction to know
that the rooms which were to have been the scene of his
ecstatic happiness were empty of life, of joy, of laughter,
for at least a little while.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The door of the darkened room burst open, and Dr.
Maclean’s hearty voice exclaimed exultantly: “Our trouble’s
over! The Home Office is going to take no further
action in the matter——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he shut the door, turning on, as he did so, the electric
light.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I had a great stroke of luck! One of the two men sent
to examine me was an old fellow-student of mine, a fellow
called Wilson, an Aberdeen chap. It made everything easy,
of course.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Putting his hat down on a table, he came close up to the
other man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My God, Harry, don’t look like that! The trouble’s
over, man—don’t you understand?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re a good friend, Maclean. I’ll never forget how
you’ve stood by me in this thing——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nonsense!” he said strongly. “I was as much in it
as you were—your poor wife was my patient, after all. I
signed her death certificate.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to ask you a question—and I trust to you to
answer it truly,” said Harry Garlett in a low, tense tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ask away, man!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor said the words jokingly, but he felt hurt and
disappointed—tired, too. He had put every ounce of power
he possessed—and there was a good deal of power in Jock
Maclean—into the difficult interview he had just carried
through so successfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you obtain an assurance that the inquiry into the
cause of Emily’s death would never be reopened?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett’s question made Dr. Maclean feel acutely
uncomfortable. It seemed to bring back, echoing in his ears,
the last words that old friend of his, Donald Wilson, had
uttered: “The matter is now closed, Maclean—unless, of
course, anything in the form of real evidence be tendered
us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So it was that for a fraction of a minute he remained
silent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I take it they gave you no such assurance?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How could they do such a thing?” exclaimed the other.
“Come, Harry, be reasonable!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Garlett started once more his restless pacing up and down
the now brightly lit room; then, all at once, he turned on
the older man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I consider myself entitled to such an assurance, and I
won’t be satisfied with less. The greatest indignity that can
be put on an innocent man has been put on me. You weren’t
present during my interview with that police inspector,
Kentworthy! At first the man scarcely took the trouble to
conceal his belief that I was a murderer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As the other uttered an impatient exclamation, he added:
“Can’t you see what it would mean to me, to Jean, to feel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>that awful possibility always hanging over us? I’ve made
up my mind to go to the Home Office myself to-morrow
morning. If they refuse to give me an assurance that the
matter is closed once and for all, I shall insist on my right
to an exhumation order.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you will do a stupid, as well as a very cruel and
selfish thing,” said the doctor sharply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cruel? Selfish? I don’t follow you——” And as the
other remained silent he went on, in a low voice, “Again I
ask you to try and realize what it would mean—not only to
myself but to Jean—if, after we had been married say six
months, or a year, we suddenly learnt that an exhumation
order had been issued.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean began to feel thoroughly angry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pull yourself together, man,” he said sharply, “and
don’t go havering on as to what might happen—I am thinking
of what will certainly happen if you follow the course
you propose.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett stared at Dr. Maclean. “What d’you
mean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I mean that you’ve really only been considering yourself
in this matter. You’re not really thinking of that poor little
girlie who loves you——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I <i>am</i> thinking of her—only of her!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re doing nothing of the sort. If you had only yourself
to think of you might insist on settling this horrible
matter at once for all in the drastic way you propose. But
to do so now would be a cruel wrong to Jean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He waited a moment, then, speaking very solemnly, he
went on:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Most people are convinced of the truth of that evil old
proverb, ‘There’s no smoke without fire.’ The fact that
your wife’s body had been exhumed, and certain portions of
that poor body submitted to certain tests by a government
expert, would never be forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose that’s true,” said Garlett slowly, and Dr. Maclean
pursued his advantage.</p>

<p class='c008'>He put his hand on the younger man’s shoulder, “For
God’s sake, let the matter rest. As things are now I regard
it as practically certain that this painful business will never
be known beyond just our four selves.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“Our four selves?” repeated Harry Garlett uncertainly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, man! Myself, my wife, Jean and you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a long pause, and Dr. Maclean, with intense
relief, believed that he had gained his point. But suddenly
Harry Garlett exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s no use, Maclean! I can’t see it as you do. I shall
go to the Home Office to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose you agree that Jean has a right to be consulted
before you take a step that may cloud all her future
life?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know Jean will agree with me,” said Harry Garlett
obstinately.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give her a chance of hearing the other side, man. Damn
it all! You do owe me something——”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned toward the door. “I’ll telephone my wife to
bring the girl up to-night.” Without waiting for the
other’s assent he left the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, for he was an upright man, and not given to deceiving
himself, Dr. Maclean stayed his steps for a moment on
the big, empty hotel landing.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was asking himself whether, after all, Harry Garlett
might not be taking the right course in settling this painful,
degrading question once for all. He had felt, in spite of the
courtesy, nay, the kindness, with which he had been treated
at the Home Office, that an uncomfortable suspicion did still
linger in the minds of the two men with whom he had had
his difficult interview. Deep in his heart he was well aware
that it was the fortunate accident of his old acquaintance
with that now important government official, Donald Wilson,
coupled, of course, with his own absolute conviction that
Mrs. Garlett had died a natural death, which had achieved
what at the moment had seemed such a triumph.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>It was five hours later. The hotel sitting room was in
darkness, save that no uncurtained room in London is ever
really dark, and there was also a little fire in the black grate.
But no one coming in casually would have seen the two who
sat on the sofa hand in hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as Jean and her aunt had arrived, there had begun
the painful, difficult consultation—if, indeed, consultation
it could be called, for Jean and the man she loved had listened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>in silence while the doctor and Mrs. Maclean tried to dissuade
Harry Garlett from taking the course he meant to
pursue.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last, after having used every conceivable argument,
husband and wife got up together.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let us go down and have a little supper,” said the doctor.
“After that you two shall come up here alone and talk it
over. Don’t be in too great a hurry to make up your mind,
Harry. Weigh everything, and, above all, remember that
‘What’s done can’t be undone.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>And now at last they were alone together. For a while
neither of them spoke, and then Harry Garlett said quietly,
“Your uncle has made me see one thing, my dearest. That
I ought to leave the decision with you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If the decision rests with me, then I say—do what you
feel right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Moving up closer to him, she whispered: “The only thing
that matters to me—surely you know it—is our love. Nothing
can take that away. After all, we’re not bound to go on
living in Terriford.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s true!” he exclaimed. “All the same, remember
that if you feel the slightest doubt I’ll put aside my wish.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I feel not the slightest doubt. On the contrary, I’m
quite sure,” she answered, without a tremor in her voice,
“that whatever you feel should be done will be well done.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Big Ben was booming out the hour of half-past ten as
Harry Garlett was ushered into one of the bare waiting
rooms of the Criminal Investigation Department. And it
seemed to him a long time before the door opened again to
admit the man he had asked to see.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Wilson was a good-humoured, cheerful-looking Scot,
very much on the alert, and, if the truth be told, though it
was a truth mercifully concealed from Garlett, a man sufficiently
interested in human nature to feel a considerable
thrill at seeing face to face a human being he was strongly
inclined to believe a successful murderer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m told you’ve specially asked to see me, Mr. Garlett.
So I take it you’ve not seen our mutual friend, Dr. Maclean?
He spent a couple of hours here yesterday, and I think I may
go as far as to assure you that unless some new and unexpected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>development should take place, the matter concerning
which Mr. Kentworthy came down to Terriford will go no
further.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Does that mean,” asked Harry Garlett quietly, “that I
may rest assured that no order for the exhumation of my late
wife will ever be issued?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Scotsman looked at him keenly. “We could not give
such an assurance to any living man, Mr. Garlett. Not
even,” he smiled grimly, “to the Lord Chancellor or the
Archbishop of Canterbury.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the speaker’s whole manner changed—it became
grave, official. “Perhaps,” he went on, “I had better send
for my colleague, and, may I add, my superior, Mr. Braithwaite?
He will tell you exactly how the matter stands.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That,” said Garlett firmly, “is what I have come here to
discover—I mean exactly how the matter stands.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Wilson left the room, and when at last, after what
seemed a long delay to the waiting man, he did come back,
he was accompanied by a younger official. Garlett, perhaps
by now morbidly sensitive, noticed that the new man only
bowed; he did not shake hands with him, as Dr. Wilson had
done.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understand that you wish to know exactly how the
matter stands with regard to the action we took on the receipt
of certain anonymous letters concerning the death of
Mrs. Emily Garlett?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What I wish to know,” said Garlett coldly, “is not how
the matter stands, but how <i>I</i> stand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As neither of the men opposite him answered his question,
he went on deliberately: “Though I believe I was successful
in convincing of my innocence the police inspector you sent
down to make inquiries, he made it clear to me that nothing
short of an exhumation would set the matter absolutely at
rest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In saying such a thing,” said Mr. Braithwaite sharply,
“Kentworthy went very much beyond his instructions. But
of course I admit that in a sense, speaking to you as man to
man, he spoke the truth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett looked fixedly at the speaker, as if suddenly
dowered with something like second-sight. He could almost
see the interrogation mark in Mr. Braithwaite’s mind: “Is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>this man standing here before me an innocent man, or that
vilest form of murderer—the secret poisoner?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Speaking in a hard, composed tone of voice, he said firmly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will be open with you, gentlemen. You probably
know that I am going to be married. Putting myself out
of the question, I feel that for the sake of my future wife
I am compelled to ask the Home Secretary to issue an exhumation
order. Surely I have the right, as an Englishman
accused—however you may gloss over the fact—of the
hideous crime of murder, to insist on the only thing that can
absolutely clear me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>At that moment Harry Garlett triumphed. The two civil
servants looked at one another, each of them convinced that
the man who had just spoken those strong, determined words
was innocent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you the slightest conception of what will happen
if the Home Secretary accedes to your request, Mr. Garlett?”
The words were uttered gravely and kindly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you realize that it will be impossible for the fact of
the exhumation of your wife’s body to be concealed from
the press—not only the local press, mind you, but the press
of the whole country?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I do realize that. In fact, everything to be said
against an exhumation has been put to me, and very strongly,
by Dr. Maclean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then why not let the matter rest for the present?” interposed
Dr. Wilson. “While it is obviously impossible for us
to give you any promise, unofficially we can assure you that
the matter is closed, and that only in the case of real evidence
of foul play would it be reopened.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Braithwaite chimed in: “Forgive me for alluding to
your private affairs, but may I say that what you are now
asking us to do may be a very grave matter for the lady who
is going to be your wife, Mr. Garlett?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We talked it over last evening, and I left the final decision
to her. So you see that it is her wish as well as mine that
the matter should be laid to rest for ever in the only way it
can be laid to rest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, speaking with deep feeling, he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Put yourselves in my place! Think what you would
feel”—he looked from one to the other of the men who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>were confronting him—“if you were situated as I am situated.
Would you not do everything in your power to put an
end, once for all, to so horrible, so hideous a suspicion?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder if I should,” said Mr. Braithwaite musingly.
“Honestly, I don’t feel at all sure!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He waited a moment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You formally ask that an exhumation order be issued,
Mr. Garlett?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I do most earnestly ask that it may be issued. Nay,
more, I regard it as my right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Both men shook hands with him, yet after the last echoes
of their visitor’s footsteps had died away, they simultaneously
exclaimed the one to the other: “I don’t know what
to think—do you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It isn’t often that you and I are so absolutely of one
mind, Wilson, eh?” Mr. Braithwaite spoke jokingly, but
there was an undercurrent of deep questioning in his voice.
“If Garlett is guilty, then he’s the most cunning devil of the
many cunning devils you and I have come across! But of
one thing we may be quite sure—nothing of a surprising
nature will be found in the poor woman’s body. If our
friend did kill her, he has completely covered up his tracks!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am inclined to believe,” said the other hesitatingly,
“that Garlett is an absolutely innocent man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In that case, God help the poor devil! He doesn’t know
what he’s letting himself in for,” observed Braithwaite.
“He’ll be a marked man all his life. Think of what a country
town can be like for malice and all uncharitableness.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder,” said the Scotsman, “if it’s the girl who’s
driven him to this extreme course? What if she’s made her
marriage conditional on all this mess being cleared up?
She may have done that—if she’s a fool. It’s plain he’s
entirely devoted to her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Kentworthy says they were talked about long before his
first wife’s death.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t forget <i>that</i> fact just now,” said Dr. Wilson
smiling. “When he first spoke of the girl I said to myself:
‘She’s the cause of all the mischief. Keep clear of the sex,
Donald, my boy!’”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Ten long days, including the quietest Christmas ever
spent in Bonnie Doon, and then on the second day of
the New Year—“A letter for you, Miss Jean, from the
Thatched House.” Elsie’s dour face softened as the girl
eagerly tore open the envelope.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>My dearest Love</span>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>I find I can’t come to-night as I had hoped to do, but I will be
with you early to-morrow morning.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Always your</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Jean remembered that a telegram had come for her uncle
a few moments ago. Now telegrams were always being
delivered at Bonnie Doon, but some secret instinct now
seemed to tell her that this time the telegram had had something
to do with her lover and his affairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>She walked into the doctor’s study, and when he saw who
it was, he opened the top drawer of the writing table at
which he was sitting, and slipped something into it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well?” he said, looking up, “Well, my dear, what d’you
want?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She came close up to the table, and he was dismayed to
see how sad and suffering was the expression on her young
face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle Jock,” she said in a low voice, “Harry has just
sent me word that he can’t come this evening. I suppose——”
and then she stopped short; somehow she could not bring
herself to say the horrible words. But at last she whispered:
“I suppose they are going to dig up poor Mrs. Garlett’s
coffin to-night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean rose from his chair; he put his arm round
the girl’s shoulder. “Yes,” he said quietly, “you have guessed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>aright, Jean. The exhumation is to take place to-night, and
Harry and I will both, of course, be present.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He could feel her trembling, and he saw her right hand
open and shut.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must remind yourself,” he went on, “that what
is going to be done to-night marks the beginning of the
end—as far as Harry’s painful ordeal is concerned. You
and I know—indeed I am convinced that even those who
have ordered the exhumation feel as sure of it as we do—that
the result will be nil; that is to say, from our point of
view, absolutely satisfactory.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know that,” she murmured in a strangled voice. “But
I don’t feel as if that knowledge made the shame of it any
easier to bear—now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He felt startled. It was the first time that Jean had
admitted that there was any shame to be faced.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nonsense!” he exclaimed vigorously. “Think what you
would be feeling—what I should be feeling—if we had the
slightest doubt about the matter?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She had moved away, and was looking at him with wide-open
eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—I don’t understand,” she stammered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Forget yourself and Harry for a moment.” He felt
that a touch of sternness, even of roughness, would do the
girl good just now. “Think of what the innocent friends,
ay, and lovers, of a real murderer must feel when the net
is slowly but inexorably closing round him. Supposing you
half suspected, or a quarter suspected, or even a hundredth
part suspected—the man you love?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl smiled; but it was a wan, pitiful smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t imagine such a thing. And you know I can’t,
Uncle Jock.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you going to answer Harry’s note?” he asked
abruptly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you think I ought?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do! I think you ought to write him a cheerful brave
letter, reminding him that this is the beginning of the end,
and that within a very short time you and he will have come
out from the darkness into the sunshine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She went straight round the writing table, and leaning
down, drew a sheet of notepaper toward her. She wrote:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span><span class='sc'>My darling Harry</span>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>I know what is going to happen to-night. I want you to remember
that it is the beginning of the end; that very soon, in a few days at
most, we shall have come out from the darkness into the sunshine.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>Your own loving</div>
      <div class='line in16'><span class='sc'>Jean</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>And then, after she had addressed the envelope, she
put her hands over her face, and burst into a passion of
anguished sobs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sheltered by the heavy pall of a dark winter night, Jean
Bower, six hours later, crept out of the garden door of Bonnie
Doon into the lonely country road which led to Terriford
churchyard. It was a bitterly cold, as well as a dark, night,
but it was not the cold and darkness which made her tremble
so violently that she found it difficult to shut the front door
behind her.</p>

<p class='c008'>For almost the first time in her life she was doing a thing
which she believed to be wrong. She knew that not only
her uncle and aunt, but also her lover, would be profoundly
distressed and shocked by what she had long ago secretly
determined she would do—that is, share, in as far as was
possible without his being aware of it, Harry Garlett’s horrible
ordeal.</p>

<p class='c008'>After an evening during which none of the three had
spoken of what was filling all their minds and hearts, she
had waited in her bedroom, trying to read, until close to
midnight. Then there had come the sound of the front door
shutting softly behind Dr. Maclean, and, allowing him a
good quarter of an hour’s start, she had crept down the
stairs, and followed him.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Jean’s eyes soon became accustomed to the darkness, and
when she knew herself to be close to the wrought-iron gate
which led into the grounds of the Thatched House, she
waited a moment, scarcely daring to breathe, for she felt
that it would be terrible for her, and horribly painful to them
both, were she to meet Harry Garlett on the way to his
sinister tryst.</p>

<p class='c008'>As she walked up the broad, now deserted, village street,
at the top of which were the church and churchyard with
only fields and country lanes beyond, there was a red glow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>over the sky, and she could see the roof and clock-tower
of the church outlined against it. She told herself, vaguely,
that a house must be on fire somewhere far away, but the
thought scarcely stirred her, so intent was she on the dreadful
thing that was about to be done.</p>

<p class='c008'>When she came close up to the lych-gate she stayed her
steps and listened intently. But there was neither stir nor
sound, and she reminded herself that Mrs. Garlett’s grave
lay the other side of the church and so even in daylight was
completely hidden from where she was now standing.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had moved a step forward, her foot kicking aside a
stone as she did so, when all at once a bull’s-eye lantern
was turned full on her. Giving a stifled cry of surprise and
fear, she waited, shrinkingly, for a stern inquiry as to her
name and business to follow. But to her mingled relief and
amazement it was a kindly, if a gruff, voice which came out
of the darkness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, missie? Come to see the fun, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The fun?” Could the still invisible man have said “the
fun”?</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the lantern was lifted a little, and by its gleaming
light she saw a burly figure dressed in a plain chauffeur’s
uniform. Slowly he turned his lantern round, and then she
became aware that drawn up under an evergreen oak overhanging
the banked-up churchyard wall was a huge police
motor car.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again the man spoke, but this time it was in a whisper:
“If ye’ll promise not to cry out, or faint, or do summat silly
o’ that sort, I’ll get you a good sight of it all——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you very much,” she faltered, feeling overwhelmed
with shame and confusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>He went on: “Though ’tis a gruesome sight, sure-lye,
for a young gal to want to see? But there! I’ve been
young myself, and I can mind when I wanted to see every
earthly thing there was to see, ’owever fearsome——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should like to see it,” she whispered back in a trembling
voice, “but only if I can do so without being seen by any one
who’s there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Trust to me, missie! I’ll make that all right,” he said
reassuringly. “They’ll be much too busy over their job to
trouble about you or me. You come right through ’ere.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>He half pushed, half led her through the lych-gate, and
turning his lantern toward the ground, slowly preceded her,
as they threaded their way between the gray and white
gravestones.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve brought a party of six,” he muttered huskily, “and
apart from the grave-diggers, and the undertaker’s little lot,
there’s the corpse’s doctor, so I understand, as well as the
fine gentleman who did ’is poor lady in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean Bower stayed her steps.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mustn’t say that—for Mr. Garlett is innocent of
having done any wrong.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She felt convulsed with pain and anger, though her words
were whispered quietly enough.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man turned round. “Every man and every woman,
too,” he muttered huskily, “is hinnocent, as we well knows,
until found guilty. But it stands to reason, don’t it, that
this kind of thing ain’t done for nothing? ’E ’as got a nerve
to be ’ere to-night at all—’e needn’t ’a been.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A moment later, turning round again, he asked with sudden
suspicion, “You’ve nothing to do with ’im—eh? You’re
not an hinterested party, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Jean Bower, who had never told a lie, lied.
“No, I’m just a visitor to Terriford,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c008'>Reassured, he went on, keeping near the low wall, as far
from the church as was possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly a turn in the narrow way between the graves
left the church to their right, and Jean saw before her what
she had come to see, and instinctively she clutched hold of
her companion’s strong arm and clung to it, feeling sick and
faint.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lighted by two big flares, whence had come the curious
glow which Jean had thought caused by a distant fire, a
group of men were moving about close to, and just below,
the walls of the old stone church; and stretching in dancing,
shadowy lines on the gravestones round, the men’s shadows
came and went in queer, grotesque shapes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Moving very slowly, her companion advanced nearer and
nearer to the strange, uncannily silent scene, at which Jean,
gathering a desperate courage from within herself, stared
with affrighted eyes. Then all at once she saw the man
whose image filled her heart.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Harry Garlett was standing almost exactly facing her, at
the head of Emily Garlett’s open grave. He seemed quite
incurious of what was being done, for he was staring straight
before him, his bare head flung back.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Home Office gent ’as ’is back turned to us,” whispered
Jean’s companion. “’E’s ’ere to see that there’s no
tampering with the poor lady’s remains.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl pressed forward, shrouded in a darkness which
was made the more intense by the bright light shed by the
flares beyond, and, gradually, she began to realize exactly
what was taking place in the lighted-up space before her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Four men, two on each side of what looked like a deep,
narrow trench, were exerting all their strength to lift the
coffin up out of what Jean knew to be the freshly opened
grave of Harry Garlett’s wife. And, after what seemed
to the agonized watcher a long, long time, they succeeded in
their task. Then there came the sound of heavy, muffled
footsteps; out of the darkness stepped two other men, and
the six together placed the coffin on to a hand bier which
Jean had not noticed before.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’ll take her to that cottage yonder: I helped to get
it ready for ’em,” muttered her companion hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What cottage?” she asked, surprised.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not better than a dog kennel!—but good enough for the
gentleman from London—him what they call a hanalist—’e
who’s the cause of many a ’anging,” whispered the man.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Jean remembered that on the other side of the
churchyard wall, standing in a field, was a kind of shanty
which she knew had been condemned, largely owing to her
uncle’s efforts, as unfit for human habitation some months
ago.</p>

<p class='c008'>She forced herself to ask what was to her an all-important
question.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it there that they’ll find out what Mrs. Garlett died
from?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord, no!” he exclaimed, astonished at such ignorance,
“that’s a long business—that’s done in London.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then what will they do there?” she asked, puzzled and
disappointed, and with no prevision of his answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, missie, what’ll be done in that cottage over there
won’t be a pleasant job. I’m glad I’m not in it.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>“What are they going to do?” she breathed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’ll take parts of the lady’s inside and put them into
jars. Then the poor soul will rest once more in her coffin.
Meanwhile, that which ’as been removed (if you take my
meaning) will be taken away to London, and it’s according
to the report of the gentleman I pointed out to you just now
whether the ’usband will get off scot-free or whether he’ll
swing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He uttered the dreadful words in a matter-of-fact tone,
and Jean turned suddenly sick and faint.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you help me back to the gate?” she muttered. “I
don’t want to stay here any longer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not just a few minutes more?” he asked, disappointed.
“If you goes now, you’ll miss the most hinteresting part of
the whole affair. They’re just going to unscrew the coffin,
and take her out, and it isn’t as if we was near enough to
see anything that ’ud frighten you——”</p>

<p class='c008'>But, already, Jean had turned and was blindly making her
way back, among the gravestones, toward the lych-gate.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was bitterly, bitterly sorry now that she had come.
She felt that as long as she lived the memory of to-night
would remain most presently and horribly vivid to her, and
she knew that it was a memory of shame and horror she
must ever bear alone.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>“Don’t ’e look like a murderer?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Course he does—he is one!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett turned sharply round. For a moment his
weary face, his shrunken eyes, glanced quickly this way and
that, seeking to find out who had uttered those cruel words.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the day following the night of the exhumation, and
market day in Grendon. On the high paved sidewalk there
paced up and down, jostling one another, a crowd of men,
though here and there a woman, a farmer’s wife or daughter,
mingled in the throng.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then all at once Garlett realized that as he stepped
quickly along, people were pointing him out to one another,
and that many of them were staring at him, some furtively,
but the majority with an eager, pitiless stare of almost savage
curiosity.</p>

<p class='c008'>A boy selling the local daily, a small sheet called <cite>The Grendon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>News</cite>, came bounding along, and he could hardly hand
the paper out quickly enough to those who had not already
got it in their hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett called out: “Here, boy, I want that
paper!” and at the sound of his harsh voice the men round
him all fell silent, and stared at him with a more pitiless
curiosity than before.</p>

<p class='c008'>He took the paper, paid the boy, and held it out. Right
across the little local sheet, in as big type as had been set
out the declaration of war in August, 1914, ran the words
“Exhumation of Mrs. Emily Garlett.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He walked on, hardly knowing what he was doing, and yet
horribly aware that his fellow townsmen and country neighbours
were now forming a lane, leaving the way clear for
him alone on the pavement.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not a face smiled in greeting, not a hand was stretched out
to him of the many hands there which had so often grasped
his in kindly friendship, or in fervent admiration of his
cricketing prowess.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last he reached what he believed would be to him a
place of refuge. But as he turned into the great square
courtyard of the Etna China factory, he saw faces glued to
every window-pane.</p>

<p class='c008'>His coming had been heralded, and all these people with
whom he had been on such happy, friendly terms till yesterday,
were now staring at him as if he were some terrible
wild beast.</p>

<p class='c008'>But having gazed, as they hoped furtively, their fill, they
melted quickly away from the windows. He was, after all,
their employer, the master of their destinies, until——?</p>

<p class='c008'>He hurried into the hall, and turned into the clerks’ room.
“Any one called yet?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, sir, no one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The man who spoke to him looked much as usual, the
other clerk had a foolish, nervous grin on his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>He walked on into his own room, took off his hat and coat,
sat down, and forced himself to open the letters which lay
as usual piled on his desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he telephoned through to the room where his young
lady shorthand writer must be awaiting his summons. But
there came no answer to his call.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>He waited five minutes, then tried to get through to her
again—without result. Then he got up and went to the
clerks’ room. “Where is Miss Faring?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>His head clerk hesitated a moment. “Miss Faring’s
mother brought a note about half an hour ago, sir. I’m
sorry I forgot it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He handed his employer a black-bordered envelope, and
Harry Garlett, walking out of the room, opened the note in
the hall.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c009'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Dear Mr. Garlett</span>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>I am sure you will agree with me that under the circumstances it
is far better that my daughter should suspend her work with you
for the present. I hope you will not think it impertinent of me to
say that you and Miss Bower have both been so very kind to Nancy
that I trust with all my heart that the terrible things that are being
said about you both are not true. Nay, I will go further, dear Mr.
Garlett, and say that I am sure they are not true.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yours very truly,</div>
      <div class='line in8'><span class='sc'>Mary Faring</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Terrible things said about Jean and himself? This was
a far greater, a more agonizing, blow, than anything he had
yet experienced.</p>

<p class='c008'>He walked into his room and, careless of possible interruption,
sat down and buried his head in his hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean—the subject of low, coarse gossip? Jean—the subject
of odious innuendo?</p>

<p class='c008'>He started up and began walking up and down the room.
The fearful ordeal of last night, the horror attendant on his
recent hideous progress through the High Street—everything
was forgotten in the news conveyed in Mrs. Faring’s letter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Garlett was a proud and sensitive man. He had put aside,
as he would have done a noxious sight or smell, those half
questions put to him by James Kentworthy, the detective,
concerning his relationship with Jean Bower. But now the
memory of those questions, those veiled insinuations, came
back, and with that memory the agonized realization that
Jean Bower had been even then suspected as providing the
motive for an otherwise motiveless crime.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, fortunately for most of us at some time of our lives,
work has to be done—whatever betide. So at last the unhappy
man sat down and began the tedious task of answering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>with his own hand the letters which otherwise he would have
dictated. As he did so, he found himself, for the first time
in his life, struggling with two distinct currents of thought—the
one superficial, concerning the letters he was writing;
the other still passionately concerned with the news contained
in Mrs. Faring’s letter. In vain he now tried to assure
himself that his and Jean’s ordeal was bound to be a short
one, and that once the Government analyst’s report was
published he would be able to take up life again exactly
as it had been.</p>

<p class='c008'>Well he knew, <i>now</i>, that life could never be the same again.
If he remained at Terriford he realized that even if he lived
to be a very old man, there would always be somebody ready
to point him out as the man who had been suspected of having
murdered his first wife for love of the woman who had
become his second.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though he had arrived very late at the factory, he had
never spent a morning there which seemed so long and
dreary. None of his usual business associates came in to
see him, no one even rang him up on the telephone. It was
as though a desert had been created round about him, and
bitterly he felt the humiliation, the degradation, of it all.</p>

<p class='c008'>At one o’clock he got up, and, putting on his hat and coat,
went into the clerks’ room: “I shall not be here this afternoon,”
and then painfully he hesitated. Yesterday he would
have added, “Should you want me—get through to Bonnie
Doon,” but that stinging sentence in Mrs. Faring’s letter
stopped his saying that.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Should you want me,” he said quietly, “I shall be at the
Thatched House after three o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He had tried to speak, to look, as usual, but he knew that
he had failed.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the hall he waited irresolutely. No, he would not go
out, as usual, through the courtyard, as perhaps another
kind of man would have done. Grimly he told himself that,
in a sense, he accepted defeat. He felt he could not face
again the stares of his workpeople and of his fellow townsmen.</p>

<p class='c008'>Taking a rusty key off its hook, he walked through the
now empty shuttered rooms which had once been the home
of his wife’s parents. He hurried through the silent, cobwebbed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>kitchen into the narrow, sunless garden. A door at
the bottom of the garden led into an alley which was an
unfrequented and generally more or less deserted way of getting
out of the town.</p>

<p class='c008'>He hurried through the door, and once out there he felt as
if he breathed a lighter air. And yet, as he hastened along,
it seemed to his excited fancy that he could hear the busy
murmur of voices, cruel, spiteful, eager voices—all talking
of him, of his poor dead wife, and, hideous thought, Jean.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last, after passing through some mean and sordid
streets, he reached the open country, and the clean, keen air
worked something like a miracle in his tortured brain. By
the time he opened the front door of Bonnie Doon he was
almost himself again, filled with joy at the thought of seeing
Jean, the only human being to whom he could pour out his
heart, and who could bring him comfort.</p>

<p class='c008'>Elsie, the cook, came quickly out of her kitchen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eh, Mr. Garlett,” she exclaimed, “I’ve been watching
for ye! D’you mind going into the doctor’s study? Miss
Jean’s not down yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’s not ill?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, no—only tired. Don’t ye fash yourself,” said the
good woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then the door of the doctor’s study opened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come in here, Garlett, just for a minute, will you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Was it his fancy, or was Dr. Maclean’s voice cold—cold
to sternness?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jean was in the churchyard last night,” began the doctor
without any preamble. “She didn’t mean us to know—but
my wife got it out of her—and it’s smashed her up. I’ve
given her a soothing draught, and I want her to stay in
bed quietly all to-day. I meant to ring you up, but we
didn’t expect you till this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He spoke in a low, preoccupied tone. “I’m sure you’ll
understand, my dear fellow,” his voice softened as he used
the affectionate appellation, “that I think it’s best you
shouldn’t see her to-day. You’ll see her to-morrow, no
doubt.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett remained silent. He was sick with horror
at the thought that Jean had been in the churchyard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why did you let her come last night?” he asked roughly.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“<i>I</i> let her come?” repeated Dr. Maclean sharply. “It’s
the last thing I should have thought her capable of doing.
It’s the first time her aunt and I have found her out in doing
anything deceitful or—well, I can only call it indelicate!
But there, she felt half distraught. It’s fortunate that it’s
only a fortnight now—it may be three weeks at the longest—before
everything will be cleared up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And how are we to get through the fortnight or three
weeks?” asked Garlett hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c008'>His mind was full of what had happened that morning,
but he told himself with relief that of what was apparently
being said in Grendon Dr. Maclean knew nothing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, come, man—show a little courage! You’ve a long
life of happiness and prosperity before you. How few can
say that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know that I’m not reasonable,” muttered Garlett.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But there’s one thing, Harry”—the older man bent forward
and laid his hand on the younger man’s shoulder.
“There’s one thing, my boy, I’m minded to say to you, and
I expect you to take it in a sensible, upright way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll try to, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Both Mrs. Maclean and myself feel very strongly that
during this time of waiting you should see very little of Jean.
We haven’t the heart to say you’re not to meet at all, though
we think that would be the best plan. But we do think you
should do nothing to give cause for any talk or gossip—even
in the village.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As Garlett made no answer, the doctor went on reluctantly,
“I can hardly bear to bring myself to soil my lips with what,
however, I feel must be said. You are probably not aware
that there has been talk about you and Jean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was not aware of it till this morning,” said Garlett in a
low, shaky voice, “though of course Kentworthy asked me
some strange questions.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ay, so he did me! Even here there’s been, it seems, a lot
of poisonous gossip. I’ve traced one story direct to Miss
Prince—a story of how you and that poor girl upstairs
walked home on the day before your wife died.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did we?” said Harry Garlett in a dull voice. “I’d forgotten
that. I daresay we did. For the matter of that I’ve
walked home from Grendon to Terriford with most of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>neighbours in the last thirteen years, including Miss Prince
herself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know that,” said the doctor quickly. “But to come
back to the matter in hand. I don’t want to be unreasonable,
but I do hope that you will both behave—well, how can I put
it?—with sense and discretion. After all, it isn’t very long
to wait; you’ll be married within less than a month from
now, and then you’ll be together for always. Till you’re
married, I’m quite sure you’d best see as little as possible
of one another.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I quite see what you mean, and I daresay you’re right.”
He was beginning to feel himself a pariah.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll be going back to the Thatched House for lunch,” he
went on forlornly, remembering vividly how only yesterday
he had been pressed to come to-day to this house from which
he now felt he was being expelled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think that will be best,” said Dr. Maclean uncomfortably.
“I’ll telephone through and say you’re coming along.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>A fortnight to the day after the exhumation of
Mrs. Garlett, Dr. Maclean, after reading his necessary
letters, walked through the hall into the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Elsie,” he said abruptly, “I want your good help. First,
go and tell your mistress that I require to see her about
something urgent and private. Then get hold of Miss Jean
and make her stay with you in here till I have done with your
mistress.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The woman, an old and trusted friend by now, just nodded
her head. “Ay,” she said, “I’ll do all that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A few moments later Mrs. Maclean hurried into her husband’s
study. “What is it?” she asked breathlessly. “You
shouldn’t frighten me like that, Jock. ‘Secret and urgent’
indeed!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lock the door,” he said briefly.</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned the key in the lock, and came over close to
where he was sitting. “What is it, Jock?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He did not answer for a moment, and then he said very
quietly: “Harry Garlett did poison his wife. He is to be
arrested to-day, and we must manage to get Jean away, if
it’s in any way possible, before that happens.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She stared across into her husband’s set face, but, though
utterly amazed and horror-struck, she uttered no exclamation
of surprise. She simply waited to hear more.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” he said irritably, “well, Jenny, did you expect
this?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>I</i> expect it?” she exclaimed. “I expected it as little as
you did. But what makes you so certain, Jock? Is there
no loophole of escape?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then she muttered as to herself, “It’s the child I’m
thinking of. What will happen to Jean—if this is true?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’ll have to go through with it,” he said grimly. And
then he handed her a letter. It was marked “Private,” and
ran as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span><span class='sc'>Dear Maclean</span>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>I feel I owe it to our old friendship to inform you that Garlett
is to be arrested to-morrow on the charge of having murdered his
wife. I may add, for your own information, that our man has found
five grains of arsenic, the largest amount ever given in his experience.
It had actually penetrated the graveclothes inside the coffin.</p>

<p class='c010'>I hope you won’t think it impertinent on my part to suggest that
you would be wise to send your poor young niece as far away as
may be. How about Iona? Should she be required to give evidence,
which I hope will not be the case, she could always come back.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yours in frantic haste,</div>
      <div class='line in12'><span class='sc'>Donald Wilson</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>There was a postscript:</p>

<p class='c010'>Of course I have no business to write you this letter. I’m doing
it for old times’ sake. You may care to know that Kentworthy,
though shaken, still believes that Garlett may be innocent. K. has
left the Government service. It might be as well for Garlett to
employ him in getting up his case. His address is 100 Chancery
Lane.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Maclean read the letter twice through. Then she
handed it back to her husband.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll never get Jean to go away,” she said quietly.
“She wouldn’t believe Harry Garlett guilty if an angel from
heaven came and told her he was.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But he <i>is</i> guilty!” exclaimed Dr. Maclean, striking the
table with his hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think you have any call to say that yet,” observed
his wife.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shan’t say it out of this room till I have to get up and
say it on oath in the witness-box,” he said sombrely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Jock! Will you have to do that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I shall,” he answered bitterly—“and be known
for the rest of my life as the medical man who was bamboozled
into giving a wrong death certificate.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dismay kept her silent. Till this moment she had only
thought of Harry Garlett, and of how all this would affect
Jean. She now realized what it would mean to her husband.</p>

<p class='c008'>She suddenly went very pale, and Dr. Maclean felt queerly
touched. He got up and laid his hand gently on her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, come, woman,” he said a little huskily. “Things
are never as bad as they look! Many a better man than I
has made that kind of mistake. As for Jean, she’s young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>yet. She’ll get over it, never fear.” As his wife remained
silent, he added: “It isn’t as if we’d been improvident—if
need be we can leave Terriford.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” said Mrs. Maclean in a low tone, “we must stay and
face it out. But as for Jean, we’ll have to make some plan.
She won’t go away now—not a hope of it. But if yon man’s
hanged we’ll get her right away; I mean to some place where
no one will have heard about this awful thing—to my sister
in New Zealand, or to the MacPhersons in San Francisco.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at her, amazed. This was foresight with a
vengeance. Why, she had already tried, judged, condemned,
and, yes, hanged, Harry Garlett!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Till this morning,” he said with a groan, “I would have
staked my life on yon man’s innocence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Mrs. Maclean said something which startled her
husband.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s all so strange,” she said musingly, “because, as you
well know, Jock, he hardly knew our Jean <i>then</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It had nothing to do with Jean!” he said violently.
“For God’s sake, Jenny, put that horrible idea out of your
mind. The truth is—I can say so to you—Emily Garlett
had become impossible, intolerable——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If the man’s a murderer, you’re just trying to find excuses
for him,” she said dryly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not excuses,” said Dr. Maclean sharply, “but a reason
for his mad and wicked act—yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now,” said his wife slowly, “which of us is to tell
the child, and what will be the best way to break it to her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think,” said the doctor hesitatingly, “that you had better
tell her, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps I had, for she’s a bit afraid of me, and she
hasn’t a shadow of fear of you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>But they might have saved themselves the trouble of their
painful little discussion, for, when they went into the kitchen,
they found that Jean had left the house without saying
where she was going.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think she saw by my face that there was trouble afoot,”
admitted Elsie regretfully, for she just looked at me and said,
“You can tell them I’ve gone up to the village.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope she hasn’t gone to the Thatched House,” said
Mrs. Maclean in a dismayed tone.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>“That is just where I feel certain she has gone,” said the
cook positively. “It’s all over the village, Mrs. Maclean,
that they will be arresting Mr. Garlett this morning. But
the poor wean don’t know that.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Driven by some instinct which she would have shrunk
from analysing, Jean Bower was hurrying toward the
Thatched House.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the first time she was going there alone; but she had
been through what had seemed to her a time of measureless
suffering this last fortnight, and now had come the breaking
point. She felt she must see Harry Garlett—and alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jean! Jean! Stop!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Miss Prince’s familiar voice, and unwillingly the
girl turned and stood at bay.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mustn’t go to the Thatched House this morning, my
dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A feeling of exasperated anger filled Jean’s already overburdened
heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have something very important to tell Harry before he
starts for the factory,” she said quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I doubt if you’ll find him at home. He probably slept at
the factory——”</p>

<p class='c008'>The older woman looked into the girl’s flushed, rebellious
face, with genuine pity and concern.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think you ought to know, my dear, that the police
came out to the Thatched House while Harry was out last
evening. They ransacked everything, and turned out every
drawer in the place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why—why did they do that?” asked Jean falteringly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Probably for the first time in her life Miss Prince remained
silent in answer to a question. She had already
heard the rumour that Harry Garlett was to be arrested this
morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me go to the Thatched House,” she exclaimed, “and
if Harry is there I’ll ask him to come out here and speak to
you. I don’t think you ought to go there alone, in any case.
Think what people would say?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am going there,” said Jean firmly, “and I hope you
won’t think me rude, Miss Prince, if I say that I don’t care
at all what people say.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Without waiting for the other’s answer, she began to run,
leaving Miss Prince staring after her.</p>

<p class='c008'>But after she had gone through the wrought-iron gate, she
saw that a little way up the broad path leading to the house
the Terriford village policeman was standing, as if barring
the way.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now Jean knew the young man well, for he had an invalid
mother whom she sometimes visited.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you business up at the house, miss?” he asked
hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>She answered, “Of course I have, Jackson, or I shouldn’t
be going there,” and walked firmly on.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, all at once, with a leap of sudden joy she saw
Harry Garlett standing by the open front door of his house.
The sight of him brought a feeling of comfort, of reassurance,
to her burdened heart. But as he came forward to
meet her, she realized that he was in a state of painful excitement
and anger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I tried to get through to your uncle about half an hour
ago,” he exclaimed, “but Elsie said he was out. I wanted to
tell him myself of the dastardly outrage committed here last
evening! It scared away the cook and her daughter, so I’m
alone here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He hurried her into the hall, and then throwing his arms
round her, he strained her to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It makes all the difference having you with me——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Poor Jean! Since this great trouble had come upon them
all, Mrs. Maclean had seemed to think it almost unseemly for
the lovers to be alone together. Even the yew edge walk
had become, by her plainly expressed wish, forbidden
ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was wonderful to be alone with him like this, heart to
heart, and lips to lips; almost too wonderful to be true.</p>

<p class='c008'>But at last the girl gently withdrew herself from Garlett’s
enfolding arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What happened last night?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose I’m a fool to mind,” he answered. “You are
the only thing that matters to me now, Jean. But I’d better
tell you about it, for you will have to know some time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes?” she said, and taking up his hand she laid it against
her cheek. Though the mere fact that they were alone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>together brought with it deep comfort as well as a hidden
ecstatic bliss of which she was half ashamed, she yet felt not
only frightened, but terribly perplexed. What did this that
had happened last evening portend?</p>

<p class='c008'>“The moment I’d turned the corner on my way to Bonnie
Doon the police came and ransacked everything here. I’ll
show you the state in which those brutes left my study!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who did all this?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I met the Grendon inspector of police and his two underlings
at the gate, as I was coming home last night, and he
said that they had acted on instructions from London.
D’you mind seeing my study, Jean? Everything is exactly
as they left it. I want Dr. Maclean to see it—the rector,
too! Of course I shall send in a claim for compensation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She followed him through the empty house, and then, at
the door of what had been an orderly, even a luxurious,
room, she stopped, amazed at the sight before her.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cupboard doors of a large Chippendale bookcase were
wide open, and the books had been roughly turned out of the
shelves and lay all over the floor. The drawers of the
writing table were drawn out as far as they would go, and
the top drawer, which had been locked, had been wrenched
open with some rough instrument.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a girl Emily Garlett had collected shells, and her small
shell cabinet had been kept in this, her husband’s study.
Even that had not been spared rough desecration. The
cotton wool on which the shells had rested had been thrown
out, and lay in wads on the carpet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is the worst room,” said Harry Garlett quietly.
“But my bedroom’s in a pretty queer state, too, and as for
the dining room, you’d think burglars had been in it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did they say what they wanted to find?” asked Jean
wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They made a regular mystery of it, and yet they were
fools enough to ask that poor old cook and her daughter if
they had found any packets of gray or white powder about!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gray or white powder?” she said uncertainly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not salt or pepper—arsenic!” he said bitterly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he again took her in his arms, and kissed her with a
passion that half frightened her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“God! What should I do if I hadn’t you?” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>She clung to him, and for a moment they forgot their great
trouble.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Jean, my darling, darling love—it’s been hell this
last fortnight!” he whispered. “D’you know that we’ve
never been alone since we came back from London?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’ve been very cruel—though they meant to be kind,”
she said in a choking voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did <i>you</i> feel them cruel?” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c008'>As only answer she pressed more closely to him, and
again in that disordered, desecrated room, it was as if
Heaven wrapped them round.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Jean who heard the sound of footsteps echoing
across the hall; and they had only just time to start apart
when a loud voice called out: “Is any one in this house?
We are looking for Mr. Henry Garlett——” And two men
in uniform burst through the half-open door.</p>

<p class='c008'>They looked taken aback when they saw that the man they
sought was not alone, and the elder of the two came up close
to where Harry Garlett was standing by Jean Bower’s side.</p>

<p class='c008'>He asked civilly, “Can I speak to you in private——?” he
hesitated, and then added the word, “sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett exchanged a quick look with the man, and
then he turned to Jean. “Will you go outside, into the garden?
I’ll join you in a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, miss, that’s what I advise you to do. You go out
into the garden,” the police inspector spoke in a very kindly,
respectful, pitying tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Jean had moved closer to her lover’s side. She took
his arm, and held it firmly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say what you want to say to Mr. Garlett here,” she said.
“I’m not going to leave him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sure the gentleman would rather we had our talk by
ourselves, miss.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Garlett said in a low voice, “He’s right, my dear. I do beg
you to leave me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She shook her head. “I can’t,” she said piteously. “Don’t
be angry with me, Harry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He tried to smile. “Nothing could make me angry with
you, my darling.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, miss, can’t I persuade you to go out into the garden?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“No,” said Jean. “I’m very sorry, but you can’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry, too,” said the man. “But duty is duty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He put his hand lightly on Harry Garlett’s free arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I now arrest you,” he said solemnly, “on a serious charge—that
of having murdered your wife, Mrs. Emily Garlett,
on the twenty-seventh of last May.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the first time that such a duty had fallen to Inspector
Johnson, and he looked far more moved than did
the man he had just put under arrest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must warn you,” he went on, “that anything you say
henceforth may be used in evidence against you.” And
then inconsequently, he added: “Have you nothing to say,
Mr. Garlett?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The only thing I have to say,” said Harry Garlett, “is
that I am innocent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He gently freed his arm from Jean Bower’s detaining
hand. “You must go home now,” he said quietly, “and tell
your uncle and aunt what has happened.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned to the inspector. “I take it, Mr. Johnson, that
I shall be allowed all reasonable opportunities of seeing my
friends?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is so,” said the man.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he made a sign to his subordinate, and they both
turned their backs while their prisoner and the girl who loved
him bade each other a silent, apparently an unemotional
farewell.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when she got out of doors, in front of the house, Jean
suddenly turned faint and giddy; it was as if her mind
became a blank. She covered her face with her hands.
“Oh, God,” she prayed, “make me keep my reason—and help
me to help Harry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, with steady steps, she walked on, past the pitying
young policeman, and past the closed car in which she
vaguely realized her lover was about to be taken to Grendon
prison.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>In every human drama where anguish, shame, despair,
play a part, there are always certain minor characters
who deserve, though they never receive, almost as much
sympathy as do the principals in the tragedy.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the doctor and his wife sat awaiting the return of Jean
Bower, they felt as if the whole of their happy, dignified
house of life had fallen into ruins about them. Deep in her
troubled heart Mrs. Maclean was quite as much concerned
with the position of her husband as she was with that of her
niece, dearly as she loved the girl. For Jean was young
enough to start another life, and, as the years went on, all
that was now happening, and about to happen, would become
a painful memory and nothing more.</p>

<p class='c008'>How different the case of her husband—to say nothing of
herself!</p>

<p class='c008'>Already Mrs. Maclean felt as if the doctor had aged perceptibly
during the last hour. He was sitting staring into
the fire, doing nothing, not even smoking. He had asked
her to tell Elsie that he would not be at home this morning to
any patients, and that all calls must be telephoned on at once
to Dr. Tasker. It was worse, far worse, than if death, unexpected,
unheralded, and coming in some peculiarly terrible
shape, had entered the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>The door opened, and they both turned round quickly.
Speaking in a hushed voice, Elsie said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought maybe you’d like to know that a machine has
just driven past. There was a policeman on the box, and
I’m afraid—I make no doubt—that I saw Mr. Garlett riding
inside.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She did not wait to hear her master’s comment on her
piece of news, but, with true delicacy, retreated quickly into
her kitchen.</p>

<p class='c008'>The husband and wife looked at each other, a dozen unspoken
questions as to the whereabouts of Jean remaining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>unuttered by either. At last Mrs. Maclean said slowly: “I
expect the child will be back in a few minutes; she can’t but
know what’s happened.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What you expect,” said her husband rather gruffly,
“is neither here nor there. What one expects never happens
in this life. The only thing of which we may be quite sure
is that she won’t have been allowed into the Thatched House.
But as to whether she will know that Garlett has been arrested
depends on——”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then as he said the word “on” they heard the front
door open and Jean’s steady, quiet voice: “Is Aunt Jenny
upstairs, Elsie?” and Elsie’s far more moved tones in answer:
“The mistress is with the doctor, Miss Jean, in the
dining room.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean and his wife stood up—the door opened, and
the girl looked from one to the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Harry’s been arrested for the murder of his wife,” she
said, “and now we’ve got to arrange for his defence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned and shut the door behind her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I couldn’t help hearing what you said to Elsie before I
went out, for I was just coming through the scullery. Was
what you wanted to tell me, both of you, anything about
Harry?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Mrs. Maclean did a fine thing. She would have
given the world to stay where she was, but she told herself
that it would be far easier for the girl to endure what had to
be said if the two others were alone together, and so, quietly,
she left the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean came over to where the doctor was sitting. And
though he still remained silent, she saw his hand make an
uncertain movement toward his breast pocket.</p>

<p class='c008'>“May I see the letter you had this morning? I think I
ought to see it, Uncle Jock.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” he said slowly, “I think you ought to see it. And
I will go further, my dear, and say you ought to ponder over
its contents very carefully.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He handed her the letter his one-time fellow-student had
written, and she read it through—once quickly, and then
once very slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last she let the piece of paper flutter down on to the
hearth-rug.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>He scarcely dared look at her, yet at last, when she did
speak, there was in her tone a ring of confidence, almost of
happy confidence, that somehow irritated him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The first thing we’ve go to do,” she exclaimed, “is to
get Mr. Kentworthy to come and see us. I don’t know what
happens when an innocent man is accused of murder. Who
looks after his interests? Would it be Mr. Toogood, the
solicitor to the Etna China Company?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose Mr. Toogood will be the solicitor in charge of the
case,” he answered gravely. “<i>I</i> intend to get a London man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She gazed at him surprised. “How d’you mean? Why
should you have a solicitor, Uncle Jock?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He got up. “Because,” he said, looking down into her
flushed face, “I gave a wrong death certificate.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He could not help adding, with a touch of intense bitterness,
“I am the simple country doctor who was taken in, and
who unwittingly abetted the murderer in his foul deed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he sat down, heavily, in his armchair by the fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>She threw herself on her knees on the ground before him.
“You don’t mean, you can’t mean, that you think
Harry——?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And there was something so piteous, so terrible, in the eyes
that looked up into his that he quailed before that searching
accusing glance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The one thing we know for certain is that Emily Garlett
died as the result of a huge dose of arsenic,” he said quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>He stood up, and, putting out his hands, raised her from
the ground. “If you want to help this man, you must face
the truth, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The truth?” she echoed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The truth that the whole world, on the evidence now
available, will consider Garlett guilty. You, I understand,
believe him to be absolutely innocent?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Absolutely innocent,” she repeated, in a steady voice;
but in her wide-open eyes there was a look of anguished
questioning as to what he believed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean could not face that look, and, hardly knowing
what he was doing, he walked over to the window and looked
out into the wintry garden.</p>

<p class='c008'>Behind him were uttered tonelessly the words: “Would
you mind my sending a telegram to Mr. Kentworthy?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>He turned round. “Do so, by all means. And then I
suppose we’d better go and see Mr. Toogood, and I’ll apply
for permission to see Garlett.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do go on calling him Harry, Uncle Jock!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will,” he said quickly. “I will, my dear. But you
know that till very lately I always did call him Garlett.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As she was going towards the door, he called her back.
“Do you feel, under the circumstances, that you ought to
stay here in Terriford?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“D’you want me to go away, Uncle Jock?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He groaned. “Want you to go away? Don’t you know
what a difference your coming here has made to me—as well
as to your Aunt Jenny? We’ve never talked about it, even
to one another, but it’s been the one blot on our happy married
life that we had no child. You’ve become our child.
Want you to go away!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She walked up to him and put her hand through his arm.
She was very moved, and for one fleeting moment she forgot
Harry Garlett.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then why,” she faltered, “why did you say that cruel,
cruel thing just now, Uncle Jock?—I mean about my leaving
Bonnie Doon?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because,” he answered painfully, “if you stay here your
life will become unendurable between now and Harry’s
trial. Your aunt and I have already talked it over. She
suggests you and she going away together to some quiet spot
where you can pass as Miss Maclean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But why should I do that?” asked the girl in a bewildered
tone. “I don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at her and saw what she said was true—that
she was still quite unaware of the tide of noisome gossip
which had flowed over her name and her innocent, girlish
past since the exhumation of Mrs. Garlett.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I supposed,” he said slowly, “that you were aware, Jean,
of what the people who believe Harry Garlett guilty take to
have been his motive.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He waited a moment, then saw that still no glimmer of
his meaning crossed her mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Has it never occurred to you that Harry Garlett is believed
to have fallen in love with you before his wife died?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No one can believe that.” She spoke with entire conviction.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“He hardly knew me, and admits that he did not
even like me. He would far rather have had some one at
the factory quite unconnected with his private life. Why,
he almost always turned over to Mr. Dodson any letters to
which answers had to be dictated!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not telling you what <i>I</i> believe—but what other people
believe,” he said in a low voice, and suddenly the full meaning
of what his words implied became clear to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t bear it,” she whispered, “oh, Uncle Jock, I can’t
bear it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>As even the best and the kindest of human beings will
feel under stress of circumstances, Dr. Maclean gathered a
cruel courage from seeing her distress.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would be very wrong to conceal from you what you are
up against, my dear. As far as the average man and woman
can see, Harry Garlett was the only human being in the
world who could be affected in the smallest degree by his
wife’s death. The question of money is ruled out—there
only remains love.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned on him in a flash. “Then you ought to admit
his absolute innocence, for you know as well as I do that he
was very much vexed with me for having written the letter
that brought him back. It took him some time,” she hesitated,
“something like a month, before we became even on
friendly terms together. After that,” there came a radiant
look into her face, “after that I admit he came to love me,
though even then——”</p>

<p class='c008'>She stopped abruptly and covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at her eagerly. Was it possible that she was
going to reveal some fact hitherto concealed by her that
might throw light on the mystery?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes?” he said, “yes, Jean? What happened then?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dr. Tasker happened,” she was smiling through her tears.
“But for Dr. Tasker, we might have gone on as we were for
a long, long time. Don’t think me unkind, for it wasn’t as if
he had ever really cared, but I have often thanked God for
Dr. Tasker!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was fortunate for her that Jean Bower had no clue to
the look which came over Dr. Maclean’s face. He was seeing
her in the witness-box, admitting her love for Harry
Garlett, unconscious that by so doing she would provide for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>most members of the jury the strongest of all reasons for the
crime for which Harry Garlett was on trial for his life.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now,” she asked, “may I go and telephone a telegram
to Mr. Kentworthy, Uncle Jock?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A few moments later his wife came into the room.
“Jenny,” exclaimed the doctor, “almost has that child convinced
me of Harry Garlett’s innocence!”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>A hush, almost of death, over Bonnie Doon. A hush
broken by a moment of almost intolerable disappointment,
for the reply to the telegram sent to Mr. Kentworthy ran:
“Am ill in bed. Will come as soon as possible. Doctor
forbids journey for three days.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean felt this to be a bad setback, all the worse
because somehow it was so entirely unexpected. And what
he felt was experienced in a far, far stronger and more
anguished degree by Jean Bower. She had pinned all her
faith on James Kentworthy. She had felt that he would be
the one tower of strength in a world where everything was
falling into ruins about her. Her misery was much increased
by the suspicion that her uncle was inclined to believe
Harry Garlett guilty. She knew only too well the generous
warmth he would have shown had he really believed her
lover innocent.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last she suggested timidly that they might go to Grendon
and see Mr. Toogood. But to that suggestion he
answered irritably, “After all, I can’t wholly neglect my
patients.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go out, do, and get that job over!” exclaimed Mrs.
Maclean sharply. And he actually went out for his usual
round, late in that long, inexpressibly dreary morning, glad
that he, at any rate, had something to do, and so was not
compelled to sit with his wife and Jean waiting they knew
not for what.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last he came in. They all sat down to their midday
meal, and then Dr. Maclean suddenly lost his temper. Looking
across the table he had seen Jean surreptitiously pushing
the little piece of meat with which her aunt had served
her under a salad leaf.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here!” he called out sharply, “you won’t do Harry
Garlett any good by starving yourself, Jean. The one hope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>the poor fellow has got is that we should all keep an even
keel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean drew the little piece of meat out into the open again,
and ate it.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last a welcome diversion was caused by Elsie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s some one on the ’phone, sir, who wants to speak
to you urgent. It’s Lawyer Toogood, I’m thinking.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor jumped up and hurried into his consulting
room. “Yes? Who is it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Toogood. I’ve seen Garlett, and I’d rather like to have
a few words with you, Maclean. Can you make it convenient
to come early this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I will. And, Toogood, may I bring my niece,
Jean Bower?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bring her by all means. But I should like to see you
alone first.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you give me any word of hope?” Dr. Maclean’s
voice instinctively lowered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait till I see you; I don’t like to say much over the
’phone. The town’s in a state of wild excitement. There’s
actually a little crowd of people round the door of my office
at this moment, just waiting to catch any one who comes in
or out!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And twenty minutes later, the patience of the idle folk
who hung about the High Street in the hope of catching a
glimpse of some actor in what was already beginning to be
called the Terriford Mystery, was rewarded.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean’s familiar covered-in two-seater dashed up
to the fine old red brick house on the door of which was a
big brass plate bearing the words, “Toogood, Lane &#38; Co.,
Solicitors,” and the group of idlers pressed forward to see
the girl who was the heroine of the case alight from the car.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She looks a deep one,” ventured a voice; and then there
came the answer from more than one pair of lips, “Ay, ay, so
she do!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her ordeal, or rather Dr. Maclean’s ordeal, for she was
unaware of the glances levelled at her, did not last long,
for the doctor and his niece were kept only a moment standing
outside the mahogany door.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Toogood had hurried downstairs as soon as he had
heard the two-seater drawing up in the street, and this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>alone would have marked the great importance he attached
to the visit, for he was not the man to put himself out unnecessarily.</p>

<p class='c008'>He shook hands with them both in a perfunctory, hurried
way, and then led the way up to the spacious first floor.
Once there, he opened the door of a back room:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now then, my dear young lady, you go in here! I’m
afraid it will be some time before I shall ask you to join us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He shut the door on her, and preceded Dr. Maclean into
the large front room which, though lined with tin boxes,
each of which was inscribed in white letters with the name
of some local worthy, might have been the comfortable
study of a man of leisure.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the flat writing table stood a bunch of sweet-smelling
hot-house flowers, for Mr. Toogood was a keen gardener.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Maclean? Sit ye down! This is a grim business,
eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean sat down, and he noticed that Mr. Toogood’s
round, genial face was set in hard lines. The two men often
had occasion to meet, and sometimes on disagreeable business,
but the doctor had never seen the lawyer look as he
looked now.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last the doctor muttered: “I don’t know what to think,
Toogood. Perhaps I’ve been lucky—but in the course of
my long practice I’ve never even suspected the secret administration
of poison.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t say the same. I think you’d be surprised if you
knew how often I’ve suspected—perhaps I ought to say half
suspected—murder! In our line of country the longing for
money is the thing that leads to crime.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There was nothing of the sort in this case,” exclaimed the
doctor. “Garlett had all the money he wanted.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was going on to say,” observed the lawyer, significantly,
“that next to money <i>love</i> is the most potent begetter of
crime.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean remained silent, and the lawyer, fingering a
ruler on his table, said musingly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Garlett was a very good-looking chap, yet he never
seemed to care for women.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Toogood unconsciously used the past tense, and Dr.
Maclean, noticing that he had done so, felt a slight shock.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>He leaned forward: “D’you think Garlett in real danger,
Toogood? I want you to tell me the truth, for it’s of terrible
moment to us—because of our niece.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A change came over the lawyer’s face. “It is indeed!”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a curious fact, but a fact nevertheless, that during
the last two or three minutes Mr. Toogood had completely
forgotten Jean Bower’s connection with the man now talking
to him. His mind had been full of her—but entirely in connection
with Harry Garlett. It was as Garlett’s secretary,
not as Dr. Maclean’s niece, that he had considered the girl’s
unhappy situation.</p>

<p class='c008'>He told himself that he must go warily, the more so that
two or three of the men who had spoken to him of the case
that morning had seemed to think it possible that Jean
Bower might find herself in the dock with Harry Garlett.
He now remembered, with a touch of acute dismay, that a
fellow lawyer had actually observed: “I’m told they found
no arsenic at the Thatched House—but that young woman,
Garlett’s lady love, being a doctor’s niece, must have access
to all kinds of poisons, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>So, setting a guard on his tongue, Mr. Toogood came back
to the matter in hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll be the most important witness, both before the
magistrates and at the trial, Maclean. I suppose you knew
Mrs. Garlett very well indeed—not only as her medical man,
but as a friend?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I think I can say that,” said the doctor cautiously,
“although the poor woman never cared for anybody apart
from the man she married. As for female friends—well,
Miss Prince was her only intimate acquaintance. She was
on bad terms with Mrs. Cole-Wright, and she never cared
to see my wife.” The doctor smiled a rueful smile—“Though
she was prim and old-fashioned, Emily Garlett
liked men very much, more than she did women. The day
before she died she had two gentlemen callers—the rector
for one, I know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You saw her pretty often, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, she often sent for me, though there was little I
could do for her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You attributed her death to violent indigestion, acting on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>the heart?” queried the lawyer, glancing down at a paper
lying on the table before him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean hesitated; this was touching on what had
already become a very sore subject with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I made a bad break there, Toogood,” he admitted painfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, well, we all make mistakes! It would have been
strange indeed had you suspected arsenic.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was debating within himself how he could introduce
the subject of Jean Bower, when the doctor suddenly gave
him a lead.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope my niece won’t be called as a witness,” he observed,
with just that touch of alteration in his voice which betrayed
to the other’s legal ear that the speaker felt very nervous.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Toogood did not answer for a few moments, and
then he put his two hands on the table and looked keenly
across at his visitor. He felt the time had come to speak
plainly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s no use beating about the bush, Maclean. I suppose
you know what’s being said in Grendon to-day, and what
will be said all over England to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c008'>As the doctor remained silent, he went on:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your niece is regarded as having provided the only motive
for the crime—if crime there was.” And, as the doctor
still said nothing, he added: “I’m not telling you anything
you didn’t know, or at least suspect—eh, Maclean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, at last, the other spoke out, “I realize that what
you say is true, but, I’d like you to believe, at any rate, that
that notion, or suspicion—I don’t know what to call it—is
a damned lie, Toogood! That’s God’s truth—though I
realize how difficult it will be to make the truth apparent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Toogood took a mouthpiece from off his table and
whistled down it, “I’m not to be disturbed on any account.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he got up, walked across to the door, opened it,
looked out on to the empty landing, and, shutting the door,
came and stood by the doctor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, Maclean! I don’t forget the night that you
and I spent by our boy’s beside just before he died—or how
good you were to me and to my poor wife. That’s why I’m
going to do my very best to help you, and to shield that unfortunate
girl. But I feel I owe you the truth, and I’m
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>afraid—nay, I’m more than afraid—I’m <i>sure</i> that if Garlett
committed this awful crime he did it for love of your niece.
Even now he can think of nothing else! When I saw him
in the prison this morning the first thing he said to me was:
‘I want you to convey a message to Miss Bower, Toogood.
I want you to explain to her that I don’t want her ever to
come here—to this horrible place.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean opened his mouth to speak, and then he shut
it again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And that wasn’t all! While I was trying to get out of
him something which might be of value when he is brought
up before the magistrates, his mind was so full of Miss
Bower that he really could hardly attend to what I was
saying!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’ve hardly seen one another, and never alone, since
the exhumation of Mrs. Garlett’s body,” observed the doctor
in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lawyer stared at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They were alone in the Thatched House this morning,”
he said abruptly. “I mean when Garlett was arrested.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sure that isn’t true,” said the doctor firmly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear Maclean, it <i>is</i> true. The Inspector came in
about quite another matter, and gave me the most moving
account of how he found them together in that empty house.
He said it would have melted the heart of a stone to see the
way the poor girl behaved. She wouldn’t leave Garlett—she
clung to him—he said it reminded him of stories he had read
of couples in the Indian Mutiny.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My God!” exclaimed the doctor, “I knew nothing of
this——”</p>

<p class='c008'>The lawyer pursued his advantage.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid there have been many things of which you
have known nothing, Maclean.” Instinctively he lowered his
voice: “To my mind, Garlett, who has been starved so long
of all natural human emotion, fell in love with your niece
at first sight. No doubt the girl was unaware of it for quite
a long time. But you’re not going to tell me that last
winter, when she first became secretary to his company, Garlett
didn’t see enough of her to have a hundred opportunities
of finding out how far more attractive she was than his
wife?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Dr. Maclean remained silent. With a feeling of sick dismay
he realized that what the other man said was only too
true.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In a way, for all his jolly, open manner, Garlett was a
secretive chap,” went on Mr. Toogood. “I’ve been his lawyer
ever since he married, but he’s never talked to me about his
private affairs, or consulted me in any way. As a matter
of fact Mrs. Garlett was far more businesslike. She knew
what she wanted; I always enjoyed a talk with her.” He
smiled rather ruefully. “There were no flies on poor
Emily——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you must admit,” chipped in the doctor, “that she
was never jealous; in that she wasn’t at all true to type,
if I may say so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re right there!” exclaimed the lawyer. “She simply
worshipped that man. Nothing was too good for him. And
yet—and yet, there was always something spinsterish about
her, eh, Maclean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean nodded: “I know what you mean. It was
that which accounted for Garlett’s attitude to the poor soul.
His attitude was much more that of a kind and attentive
nephew than that of a husband—still, he didn’t seem to
mind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rubbish—stuff! Of course he minded! You and I have
met here to-day to look facts in the face. To throw that
still young man with an exceedingly attractive, and, I’m told,
lively, intelligent girl, was just tempting providence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s done every day—in all the business offices in the
world,” said the doctor defensively.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Toogood began toying with some of the papers on his
table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll tell you one thing I heard last night,” he observed
without looking up, “in the bar of the King’s Head Hotel,
as a matter of fact. It was asserted that within a week of
Mrs. Garlett’s death your niece received by post an anonymous
gift of a most beautiful diamond ring. If the purchase
of that ring can be traced to Garlett, it will produce
a very unpleasant impression at the trial.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor felt a strange sensation suddenly sweep over
him. He had often seen a woman in hysterics, and he had
all your medical man’s contempt for that special form of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>disordered feminine nerves, but now he felt as if he himself
might easily burst out crying and laughing together.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That ring,” he exclaimed, “was my wife’s gift to her
niece on the girl’s twenty-second birthday. It is a poor
little bit of a thing, with a turquoise in the middle and two
small pearls, one on either side. One of the pearls had
gone dead, and my wife sent it away to have it replaced by
a good pearl. So she arranged that the gift should reach
our niece anonymously on her birthday. If the stories that
are being told of Garlett and Jean are on a level with <i>that</i>
story——”</p>

<p class='c008'>The other raised his hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should be deceiving you, Maclean, were I to admit that
all, or even most of the stories now being told concerning
your niece and Garlett are as easily refuted as is apparently
this story of the diamond ring. Let us simply take what we
know to be true.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How d’you mean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What happened after Mrs. Garlett’s death? Garlett gave
out he was going away for a long time—perhaps for as long
as a year. I thought it odd that he didn’t come to see me,
to make the arrangements any ordinary man of business
makes when going away for so long a period. But he just
sent me a hasty note as to the proving of his wife’s will, and
left the very day of the funeral! I thought his conduct
very strange then, and I don’t mind telling you now that I
hope the other side won’t get hold of it. But there’s one
thing we can’t keep from them—that is Garlett’s sudden
return at the end of three months. Now why did he do
that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because of old Dodson’s state of health,” replied Dr.
Maclean hotly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The direct cause of his return was a letter from your
niece. He told me that himself the first time I met him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That letter,” said Dr. Maclean sharply, “was written
on my advice—in fact she showed me the letter before she
sent it off to Garlett. The girl was placed in a very difficult
position at the factory.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know that,” said the lawyer quickly. “Everybody
knew that it was most awkward for the girl. Old Dodson
used to make love to her. I heard about it at the time. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>believe he went so far as to propose marriage more than
once!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean stared at Mr. Toogood in amazement. He
knew that this was true, but he had thought it was a secret
between him and Jean. He had not even told his wife.
The other read what was passing in his mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re surprised, my good friend, at that fact being
known? Probably Miss Jean never told a soul except, perhaps,
you——”</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good God, man! D’you suppose that in such a place
as the Etna China factory every thing that happens isn’t
known?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hold to it that no one can say Harry Garlett fell in love
with my niece before his wife’s death,” said Dr. Maclean
firmly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose you wouldn’t go so far as to declare that
Garlett didn’t fall in love with her the moment he came
back, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think he did,” was the reluctant answer, “but I’m convinced
he didn’t know it himself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish I was as sure of that as you are. But I agree that
he wouldn’t have spoken so soon if it hadn’t been that he
found that Tasker was after her, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean stared in fresh astonishment at the lawyer.
“There’s very little going on hereabouts that <i>I</i> don’t
know,” remarked Mr. Toogood.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a pause, then: “Whom are you going to get to
defend Garlett?” asked Dr. Maclean eagerly, “or haven’t
you yet made up your mind?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The other smiled—a superior smile. “The moment I
learned that Garlett was to be arrested I got a call through
to our London agents and I secured Sir Harold Anstey.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The man who got Mrs. Panford off?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course! He’s the greatest of living advocates, and
at first I was afraid there was going to be a hitch. The
man’s so gorged with money and success that he can pick
and choose his cases——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Surely you don’t think we could have done better?” asked
the lawyer, nettled.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“I suppose not—and yet, Toogood, only last week I read
somewhere that Anstey’s nickname is ‘the murderer’s
friend.’ We don’t want to condemn Garlett beforehand,
eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Toogood leaned forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It will take the whole of Sir Harold Anstey’s wit and
skill to save our man from the gallows. Make no mistake
about that! Still, there’s one hopeful feature. I’ve found
out—unofficially, of course—that the Crown people have
been in touch with every chemist in every place where our
friend ever played cricket in the last ten years! But they’ve
found nothing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then they haven’t traced arsenic in any form to Garlett’s
possession?” asked the doctor eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So far that’s the one missing link—and a very important
link it is! By the way, you’ve never had a dispensary, have
you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The question was asked carelessly, but the doctor knew
very well what was in the lawyer’s mind, and his thoughts
flew to the other side of the book-lined wall to his left—to
the room where Jean Bower was sitting, waiting for this long
interview to end.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” he said quietly, “I have never had a dispensary,
Toogood. For what it’s worth, I may tell you that I make
it a rule to keep no drugs in my house at all. Were it otherwise,
I should be constantly worried by the village people.
When I prescribe anything of the kind they’ve got to trudge
into Grendon to get it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was on the tip of his tongue to mention Miss Prince
and her amateur doctoring, but he refrained. After all, Miss
Prince, whatever her special knowledge, could no more procure
poison than could the simplest cottage wife in Terriford
village. So, after a moment’s pause, he only added: “How
about a statement from me, Toogood?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think we had better let the Crown people see you first,”
said the solicitor thoughtfully. “After all, you’ve nothing to
conceal. So it may be better for you to be a Crown witness
friendly to our side.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Both men stood up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should like to ask you one delicate question, Maclean”;
the lawyer hesitated, then went on: “Of course you are aware
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>that the fellow who got up this case originally—I mean Kentworthy—procured
a deposition stating that Garlett and some
young woman used to meet in a wood at night last spring.
Are you certain that that young woman was not your niece?
Forgive me for asking the question. I won’t press it, if
you’d rather not answer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d stake my life that it was not my niece!” exclaimed
the doctor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Without going quite so far as that, I’m inclined to agree
with you, and it confirms a view I’ve formed in the last few
hours.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What view is that?” asked Dr. Maclean, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My view,” said the solicitor quietly, “is that there was
a second woman in Garlett’s life. A woman who was never
seen in Terriford at all—whom he probably came to know
years before he ever saw your niece. If he had some secret
married woman friend who had, say, lately become a widow,
we have a second person who may have had an interest in
Mrs. Garlett’s death.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That seems very far-fetched,” observed the doctor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In a murder case, nothing is too far-fetched if it throws
an element of doubt into the jury’s mind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see what you mean,” said the other doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Has any one turned up yet to take a statement from Miss
Bower?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean was taken much aback by the ominous question.</p>

<p class='c008'>“D’you mean,” he exclaimed, “that my niece can be compelled
to be a witness at Garlett’s trial for murder?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’ll be a leading witness,” was the answer. “I thought
you realized that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She never even saw Mrs. Garlett,” said the doctor in a
low voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Bower will not be questioned as to her relations
with Mrs. Garlett, but with Mrs. Garlett’s husband,” observed
Mr. Toogood.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean groaned.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s hard, Maclean, but if your view is the right one, if
the girl is absolutely innocent of any wrong-doing, she’ll
come through all right. I’m a firm believer in the old saying
that ‘Truth will out—even in an affidavit!’ And now we’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>better have her in, for I must give her that message from
poor Garlett.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He left the room, and a moment later returned with Jean
Bower.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I had a talk with Mr. Garlett this morning, and he asked
me to tell you that he hopes you will make no effort to see
him while he is in prison, Miss Bower.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As a look of deep unhappiness flooded her quivering face,
he added hastily:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sure he is acting in the wisest, as well as in the kindest,
way for both of you. Though I should not have suggested
his message, I heartily approve of his having sent it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shall I be able to write to him freely? Or will our letters
be read?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid that your letters will all be perused by the
governor. Mr. Garlett is allowed to communicate with me,
as his legal adviser, quite privately, and I think it possible
that Dr. Maclean may be allowed to see him alone. But
with regard to you—well, I doubt if even a wife’s letters are
given unopened to a prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see,” said the girl dully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But that must not prevent your writing him cheerful letters,”
went on the solicitor. “The great thing you’ve got
to do is to keep up the man’s spirits. Your uncle here tells
me that you are absolutely convinced of Mr. Garlett’s innocence?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was too choked with tears to do more than nod.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have a splendid counsel—the best, I think I may say,
in Europe. I’m sure you’ve heard of Sir Harold Anstey?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Now Jean Bower had also seen a photograph of the
famous advocate in a picture paper, and underneath the
portrait had been printed the words: “Sir Harold Anstey,
affectionately known at the Bar as ‘the murderer’s friend.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sir Harold is a wonderful man,” went on Mr. Toogood
eagerly; “I shall never forget having seen him once in court.
It was in the great Panford case. There didn’t seem a
hope for the woman in the dock, but he got her off! He
has an astonishing way with a jury.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see,” said Jean, again in that toneless, dull voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And then there’s another thing. It’s everything for a
witness to have Sir Harold with him or her. I suppose—”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>he hesitated uncomfortably—“I suppose, Miss Bower, that
you realize that a gentleman will soon come from London
in order to take a statement from you. On that statement
you will be examined and cross-examined—so you must
be careful what you say or admit when answering his questions.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I quite understand that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean had already regained her composure, and it was well
that she had done so, for, as Mr. Toogood escorted his important
visitors down to the front door, by some curious
accident every human being in the substantial house happened
at that moment either to have business in the hall, or to be
standing at one of the doors that gave into the hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lawyer felt vexed. And yet——? Yet even he felt
the general excitement contagious. He could not help being
glad that his firm was about to play a prominent part in what
was evidently going to be a famous case. It was also satisfactory
to reflect that Harry Garlett, unlike the vast majority
of criminals, was a wealthy man, and that the huge costs
were thus certain to be paid.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even so, as he walked upstairs back to his own room, Mr.
Toogood told himself that Jean Bower was the last kind of
young woman for whom he would have been tempted to
commit murder twenty years ago. She seemed so quiet, so
dull, so unemotional.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Toogood recalled the last time he had been out to
Terriford. It had been to take the poor doomed woman’s
instructions as to her will. She had only a few thousand
pounds to leave, for she had settled the bulk of her fortune
on her husband years ago. And suddenly he reminded himself
that neither he nor the doctor had mentioned Miss
Agatha Cheale, one of Mrs. Garlett’s legatees, who had been
actually present at her death. She would be a witness, and
an important witness, for the defence, for she, at any rate,
could testify as to the excellent terms on which the husband
and wife had been.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Elsie, the cook, was an early riser and worker, but even
she had been exhausted by the doings of the long day
on which Harry Garlett had been arrested. So she came
down later than usual the next morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was still rather dark, so she turned on the electric light,
and, after she had lit the fire and put on a kettle of water, she
began bustling about the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c008'>All at once, and for the first time in her life, she gave a
suppressed scream, for three pale faces were glued to the
kitchen window, and for an awful moment she thought they
were the spirits of dead men.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the woman’s strong good sense asserted itself. Spirits
don’t wear great coats and billy-cock hats. Looking straight
into the three staring faces, she hurried to the front door
and unlocked it. At once the three men faced about and
stood before her, and, in the hazy morning light, she saw the
motor which had brought them standing outside in the road.</p>

<p class='c008'>The youngest of the strange-looking visitors, a “cocky-looking
young man,” so Elsie told herself, took off his hat
and held out his hand; but Elsie kept her hands down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it the doctor you’re wanting?” she said, sharply.
“And what d’you mean by behaving so unmannerly? You
gave me the fright of my life—if it’s any pleasure to you to
know it.” And then, to her indignation and surprise, the
cocky young man bent a little forward, took up her right
hand and pressed into it a pound note.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We want five minutes’ talk with Miss Jean Bower,” he
said in a husky whisper. “Don’t think we’re going to
frighten the young lady, or insult her in any way—we only
want a few moments, which will be all to her advantage.
Can you conveniently manage that for us?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Elsie crunched up the pound note and flung it straight at
his face. To her regret it did not touch either of his eyes,
it only hit his nose.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>“How dare you offer me your dirty money?” she exclaimed.
“You make yourself scarce, young man, or I’ll go
and ring up the police!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The police won’t be able to help you,” but he spoke with
less assurance. “We have a perfect right to try to see this
young lady. In fact, as I hinted just now, it will be better
for her, and better for Harry Garlett, too, for her just to
see us and tell us her side of the story. We each represent
a big London paper.—Crawford?” A tall, fair youth stepped
forward. “Let me introduce the <i>Live Wire</i>!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Elsie could not but feel thrilled. This was the first time
she had ever seen a newspaper man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now then, Angus—don’t be shy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The oldest man of the three, in answer to that remark,
moved a little nearer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think it will be to the poor girl’s advantage to see us,”
he said gently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s the <i>Sunbeam</i>—a bad poet in his rare moments of
leisure, and, I take it, a fellow countryman of yours, Mrs.
Housekeeper!”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was something boyish about the impudent young
fellow, and Elsie unconsciously melted a little. Also she
had been impressed by the few words uttered by “Angus.”
There might be something in what he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You all go up to the village,” she said suddenly, “and
put in an hour at ‘The Pig and Whistle.’ Then you come
back here. By then I’ll have told the doctor what you say.
Maybe he’ll let Miss Jean see ye.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The three men consulted together, and then the man who
had not yet spoken, he of the <i>Live Wire</i>, came forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here,” he began, “if we do that—I admit we’ve
no business to come and disturb you so early—can we rely
on you that no one will get in before us? I and my friends
here came down from London last night, determined to be
the first in the field. All we ask is some kind of statement
from Miss Bower. She’ll have to give one sooner or later
to the press, and we represent three big papers. We don’t
want to be let down by some fellow who stayed in bed up
to the last minute and had a good breakfast before starting
on this job.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think I’ll go so far as to promise ye that no one else
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>will see the doctor or Miss Jean before you come back. Will
that satisfy ye?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then the Scotsman came close up to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here,” he said in a low voice, “I’m sure you
could tell me something that would be worth while hearing?
What sort of a girl is this young lady who’s brought
all the trouble about? You must know the truth—if any
one knows it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Elsie looked at him shrewdly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, my bonny man,” she ordered, “you just go
and join the other two. You won’t get anything more out
of me because you come from Aberdeen, and don’t you be
expecting of it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Though you’re so unkind to me, I’ll be kind to you,”
he answered significantly. “See that every door and window
in this house is tight shut this morning. There’s a swarm
of reporters coming out from Grendon. The public is just
thirsting for a good murder mystery,” and then he ran off
to join the other two, who were already in the car.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hurrying through her kitchen Elsie slipped the bolt in the
back door which gave into the scullery, and glad was she
that she had done so when a few minutes later there came a
loud knock on the bolted door. She started so violently
that she nearly dropped the kettle of boiling water she had
taken off the fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it was only the milkman, who had been amazed to
find the door locked against him. He and Elsie were old
cronies, but when he ventured on just a word—and it was a
kindly word, too—with regard to Miss Jean, she answered
him so roughly that he was quite offended.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You needn’t bite my head off,” he said in an injured tone.
“Nobody talks of anything else in Terriford, and no more
they won’t till that fine gentleman, Mr. Harry Garlett, has
been strung up. I’d go a good way to see ’im hanged, that
I would! Think of all the trouble he’s brought on your poor
young lady—to say nothing of the good doctor and his
missus.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And what if I say that I believe Mr. Garlett to be innocent?”
asked Elsie pugnaciously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say your ’eart, cook, was better than your
understanding,” he answered tolerantly.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>It was an hour later, nearly nine o’clock, when Mrs. Maclean
touched her still sleeping husband. She had got up at
the usual time, for all that they had talked till two in the
morning, debating every point of the mysterious and terrible
business with which they were now so closely and so painfully
connected.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jock?” she said in a low voice, “it’s time to get up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He opened his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that you’re saying? I wish you’d let me sleep
a little longer, Jenny.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, so I should have done——” and then she stopped
short.</p>

<p class='c008'>Walking across to the window, she drew the blind a little
way up. “Get out of bed for a minute, and come over here,”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Together, in silence, husband and wife gazed out on what
was to them a most surprising sight. The drive up to their
front door, as well as the road beyond, was blocked with
vehicles—old-fashioned flys and motors, closed and open.
In one of the cars a man was standing with a huge camera
bracketed on the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My God!” exclaimed Dr. Maclean, and then with a
groan, “I suppose we must expect this kind of thing, Jenny,
till we’ve got that child away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ay,” she answered. “This will surely show her that
she can’t stay here. But I’m glad she’s having her breakfast
in bed this morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As they gazed down they saw one man after another
came up to their front door, try the handle, look up at the
knocker and then walk away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whatever can Elsie have done to prevent their knocking
and ringing the house down?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She has put a notice on the knocker,” said Mrs. Maclean,
in a low voice. “Three London newspaper men were here
at seven, it seems, but she persuaded them to go away. They
told her there would be a lot of men out by nine o’clock, so
she tied a label on the knocker, with ‘Please do not knock
or ring bell’ written on it. But she has one of the kitchen
windows open, poor woman, though it’s a bitterly cold day,
and she just parleys with them through it. We shall have a
lot to thank Elsie for, Jock, when all this trouble’s over.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“I’ll get up now,” he said, shivering not so much with cold
as with horror at the thought of what did, indeed, lie before
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve got your bath nice and hot.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He took her hand and patted it. “Now you go down and
tell Elsie that I’ll deal with these gentry as soon as I’m up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve arranged for your breakfast to be brought up here
on a tray. You may as well wait till you’ve had that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps I might,” he agreed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’re all round about the house,” she went on, “their
faces just glued to the windows trying to get a glimpse of
Jean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor had just finished his hasty breakfast when
there came a knock at the bedroom door and Elsie appeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Please, sir,” she said in a hesitating voice, “the three
men who came very early this morning have come back.
They’re from big papers, and I’m thinking ’twould be best
for ye to see them. I promised no one should see ye before
them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at her sternly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You had no business to make such a promise, Elsie. I
do not wish to see anybody.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid that ye’ll be well advised to see them,” she
said in a subdued tone; “their newspapers are read a lot in
these parts, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He got up. “You’re a wise woman, Elsie. I’ll take your
advice. Are they in my study?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no, sir. They’d be seen there. I’ve got them in the
scullery.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And it was standing in the cold, dark scullery, in which
he had not been for years, that Dr. Maclean confronted the
three inquisitive strangers, his anger breaking out afresh
that he should be subjected to so horrible and degrading an
ordeal.</p>

<p class='c008'>As to the one thing they all so eagerly desired, he was
absolutely firm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is quite impossible for you to see my niece. And if
you did see her, there is nothing which she could say to
you that I cannot say. Ask me any questions you like, and
I will try to answer them truthfully.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then they did ask him questions, foolish questions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>and wise questions, dangerous questions and harmless questions,
clever questions and stupid questions! The doctor
was too new to the game to ask them to read over to him
what they had been writing down so busily. But at last,
with infinite relief, he shook hands with each of the three
and let them out, one by one, into the little yard from which
ran a separate way to the high road.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was going through the kitchen, when they were startled
by a loud, imperative double knock on the knocker which,
so far, no one had touched that morning. The front door
bell also pealed through the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You wait just inside here, sir. I’ll go to the door. I’ve
got it on the chain. No one can force their way in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Elsie purposely left the kitchen door open, and soon the
doctor heard a stern voice say:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Please take off the chain and admit me at once. I’m a
police inspector sent down by the Director of Public Prosecutions.
I’ve come to take statements from Miss Jean
Bower and Dr. Maclean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The tone of the speaker was not pleasant. But a moment
later, to Dr. Maclean’s relief, he heard the same voice apparently
addressing a small crowd of men who had gathered
round him. They could be seen through the window of
the kitchen edging closer and closer to the now open front
door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you newspaper people don’t show a little more good
feeling and decent regard in such a case as this we shall have
a Bill put through Parliament making it illegal to take any
photograph or any interview in connection with any murder
case as yet untried! That wouldn’t suit some of you, I
reckon? There’s nothing doing this morning, apart from
what I’ve come to do, so I advise you to be off.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean heard Elsie’s voice: “If you’ll come into the
doctor’s consulting room, sir, I’ll go and tell him that you’re
here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should like to see Miss Bower.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Bower’s still in bed sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall have to see her in bed, if she’s not inclined to get
up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sure she’ll get up, sir. Will you please come this
way?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Very different from James Kentworthy was the man
whom the doctor greeted a moment later. He was tall and
thin, with a clever stern face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My name is Fradelle, Dr. Maclean. And it is my duty
to take from you and from Miss Jean Bower the statements
which will be used by the Crown in the forthcoming inquiry
concerning the death of Mrs. Emily Garlett.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will, of course, put all the information in my power
before you,” answered the doctor quietly. “But is it really
necessary that you should take a statement from my niece?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Most certainly it is. I understand that Miss Bower is
in bed. That does not mean, I presume, that you consider
her too ill to give me a statement to-day?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” said Dr. Maclean, “I could not honestly say that.
But the girl is terribly distressed, Mr. Fradelle.” He hesitated
and then added, “She believes Mr. Garlett to be absolutely
innocent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So I understand,” said the other dryly.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>An hour later, Dr. Maclean, getting out of the chair where
he had sat while he was being interrogated, exclaimed, “I
will fetch my niece, Mr. Fradelle.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The early morning mist had cleared away; it was a brilliant
sunny day, so brilliant as to seem to mock the doctor’s feeling
of despondency and distress.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every question put to him had seemed deadly in its import—how
different from that first interrogation from James
Kentworthy!</p>

<p class='c008'>The most relentless duel of words—and a duel it had been
between those two men, shut up in that cozy, shabby, consulting
room—had concerned the strawberries eaten by Mrs.
Garlett the evening preceding the night of her death. At
first the doctor had not seen the trend of the younger man’s
questions, as he had assented, without much thought, to a
statement that Mrs. Garlett had been given the strawberries
by her husband.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then suddenly he had exclaimed, “You realize that I’m
not speaking from knowledge, but only from hearsay, Mr.
Fradelle?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The other seemed taken aback. “How do you mean,
doctor?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>“I was simply told by Miss Cheale that Garlett had probably
given them to the poor lady.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Even so, I presume that you have no doubt Garlett did
give his wife the strawberries?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well——”</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor hesitated a moment; he was tired and somewhat
confused. At last he replied evasively: “Garlett
strongly denies that he even saw the little dish of strawberries,
and he further asserts that, knowing how delicate
was his wife’s digestion, nothing would have made him give
them to her so late in the evening.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Fradelle frowned. He consulted his notes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There seems very little doubt that the arsenic was administered
in the sugar spread over the strawberries. Still,
from what you now say, there seems to be no direct evidence
at all as to who gave the strawberries to the poisoned
woman?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The one person who could give you authentic information
as to what happened on the evening before Mrs. Garlett’s
death is Miss Agatha Cheale, who was Mrs. Garlett’s housekeeper-companion.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope to see this Miss Cheale as soon as I am back in
London,” said Mr. Fradelle. “I made two attempts to see
her the day before yesterday. I tried at the place where
she has a flat, and then I went to the office where she works,
but I was unfortunate both times. I take it to be unlikely
that the defence have got hold of her yet?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They may have done so,” said the doctor dubiously,
“She was on very good terms with both Mr. and Mrs. Garlett.
In fact Miss Cheale is, in some way, related to Mr.
Garlett. I think it would be very painful to her to be among
the witnesses for the prosecution—though not more painful,
I feel sure, than it is to myself,” he concluded ruefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I take it Miss Jean Bower will be an unwilling witness,
Dr. Maclean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know that my niece will be a truthful witness——”
he looked rather straight at the thin tight-lipped man who
sat with his back to the light, in shadow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I trust so, though a woman witness is seldom as truthful—perhaps
I ought to say as straightforward—as would
be a man in her place. Too often your honest, truthful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>woman witness is such a fool that, without meaning it, she
gets confused and begins to lie!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My niece is not at all that sort of woman,” said the
doctor coldly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Perhaps the last words uttered by Dr. Maclean prejudiced
the stranger, for the glance he cast on the pale, sad-faced
girl who a few moments later entered the room was far from
kindly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean Bower walked over to her uncle’s writing-table and
sat down in his big chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked such a little slip of a thing that even a harder
man than was Mr. Fradelle might have been moved by
her look of fragility, deep sadness, and youth. But, like
so many clever people, the Crown inquisitor was one of
those men who find it difficult to change their minds. He
had made up his mind that Jean Bower was the villain of the
piece. He felt convinced that it was for love of this girl
that Garlett had committed a cruel crime. Far from having
any wish to spare her, he hoped to convict her lover, if not
herself, out of her own mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Bower,” he began, in a rasping, unpleasant tone,
“I must ask you to give me your whole attention, and I want
no wordy explanations. What is required are straight,
simple answers to what I think you will admit to be straight,
simple questions.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean bent her head. She felt not only frightened, but
utterly lonely and forlorn.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are, I believe, aware that you are to be among the
witnesses called by the prosecution, that is, by the Crown, at
the forthcoming trial of Henry Garlett for the murder of
his wife. I want you to understand quite clearly that you
will be examined on what you tell me to-day—examined, that
is, by the prosecution and cross-examined by the defence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean Bower was in the condition in which many a poor
wretch must have been during those periods of the world’s
history when such an examination as she was about to undergo
was always carried out with the aid of physical torture.
While determined to say nothing that could implicate
the man she loved, she felt too oppressed and bewildered to
make full use of her wits.</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at the paper he held in his hand. “You became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>secretary to the Etna China Company last April? I take it
that you were already acquainted with Mr. and Mrs. Garlett
before you obtained that appointment?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did not know Mrs. Garlett,” she answered in a toneless
voice. “But I had seen Mr. Garlett two or three times.
My aunt had taken me to call on him at the Etna China factory,
and I had seen him walking about the village.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, Miss Bower”—his voice was at once stern and
contemptuous—“you are, I understand, Dr. and Mrs. Maclean’s
adopted daughter? Do you mean to tell me that you
were not acquainted with the lady who was your uncle’s
principal patient?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I lived with my father in the north of England till last
February, and though I always accompanied Dr. and Mrs.
Maclean on their holidays, I had not been in Terriford since
I was a child.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked at him quite straight.</p>

<p class='c008'>“While I was doing war work I took no holidays. My
father worked himself literally to death, as did so many men
who were too old to join up. After the war he became an
invalid, and I nursed him till his death, just a year ago.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see. By a strange chapter of accidents you had not
been to Terriford for many years till you came here to live
last winter?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But after you’d become secretary to the Etna China Company
I take it you saw Mr. Garlett constantly, he being managing
director of the business?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I used to see him quite often—not every day, but
on most days.” She nearly added—“Most of my work lay
with Mr. Dodson,” but something made her refrain from
even making that true statement of fact.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, Miss Bower”—he waited for some seconds, while
she remained silent—“I’m going to ask you a question which
I fear will be very disagreeable to you. I cannot force you
to answer it truly, but I advise you in your own interest to
do so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She said nothing, and he went on:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did Mr. Garlett, during the month that elapsed between
your coming to the works and his wife’s death, ever make any
improper advances to you?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Twice she opened her mouth to speak, and twice the one
word “Never!” she wished to utter, would not come.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was bitterly angered and shocked by the blunt question,
and to the man who gazed into her now flushed and
quivering face her silence proclaimed, if not her own guilt,
then certainly that of the man who would soon be on his
trial for murder.</p>

<p class='c008'>Perhaps because he felt he had scored a great point he
went on in a kindlier tone:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry to have to press you about this matter, but it
is far better you should tell me now than have it dragged
out of you when you are in the witness-box. I suppose I
may take it, Miss Bower, that there were”—he hesitated,
then brought out awkwardly the words—“love passages, no
doubt of a comparatively harmless kind, between yourself
and Mr. Garlett?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She started to her feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There were no love passages,” she cried passionately,
“none, none at all! I hardly knew Mr. Garlett. Oh! do
believe that! Indeed, indeed it’s the truth!” More calmly
she added: “The cricket season was beginning, and he was
constantly away from home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And yet you told me just now that you saw him most
days at the factory?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He used to come in for a few moments to see his letters.
I was generally present when he did come in, with the man
who really managed the business—Mr. Dodson.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He glanced down at the paper he was holding.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And yet,” he observed, “slight as was your acquaintance
with your employer, you walked back with him from Grendon
to Terriford the day before Mrs. Garlett’s death. Or
do you deny having done that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She sat down again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did I?” she said falteringly. And then she exclaimed—while
he told himself that she was perhaps the best actress
he had ever encountered in the course of his work—“Yes,
I did! I remember it now. We came in to Miss Cheale’s
sitting room just when she had dismissed a servant. But
for that I should not have remembered having walked home
with Mr. Garlett.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now that your memory has become more clear, Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Bower, I want you to remember something else. At what
time—I mean about what date—was the word ‘marriage’
first mentioned by Mr. Garlett with respect to yourself?”
He leaned forward. “Was it before Mrs. Garlett’s death, or
immediately after it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again she looked at him quite straight. She could see his
shadowed face—to her it was the face of a sneering devil.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The first time we actually spoke of our marriage,” she
gave a quick, convulsive sigh, “was in answer to a question
asked by my aunt the day after we had come to an understanding,
early in November.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, come!” he exclaimed roughly, “that is what a mere
man calls quibbling, Miss Bower. You know what I mean!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not know what you mean. If you mean did Mr.
Garlett ever make love to me before his wife’s death, I answer,
‘No, never!’ He has told me since that instead of
liking me, as many a man may like a young woman in his
employment, he disliked me. He thought me too—too—”
she sought for a word, and then faltered out the word “‘self-assured.’
The person who liked me, who tried to make love
to me, was old Mr. Dodson.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She covered her face with her hands. “Why do you force
me to say these horrible, degrading things?” she asked
brokenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>He felt embarrassed, even perhaps slightly ashamed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are making my task difficult, Miss Bower. Believe
me, I have no wish to make you say anything either horrible
or degrading. But it is my duty to ask you certain painful
questions.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He went on, in a more conciliatory tone. “I am to take
it, then, that Henry Garlett never made love to you at all till
the day when he became engaged to you early last November?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” she said, looking up, “that is the truth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You ask me to believe”—but there was no jeering touch
in his voice now—“that Mr. Garlett asked you to become his
wife with no preliminary love passages at all?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” she said steadily. “I ask you to believe that,
because it is true. After Mr. Garlett’s return, when we had
worked together for some two months, seeing each other
constantly, there came a day—a day——”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>She could not go on.</p>

<p class='c008'>He said quickly, “You mean that there came a day when he
realized that he loved you—that is what you want me to
understand?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She bent her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>He got up and went and stood opposite the writing table,
so that for the first time she was able to see him quite clearly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I formally ask you if Mr. Garlett ever made love to you
before his wife’s death, or ever spoke to you of marriage till
within the last few weeks?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He never did.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will be ready to swear to both those statements in
the witness box?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He came round to where she was standing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you read what I have written?” he asked. “As
you see, it has boiled down to very little, but I wish to be
quite sure that I have got everything quite correct?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She read down the two sheets of bold, clear handwriting.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” she said, “that is exactly what I have said.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was surprised that he had put it all down so fairly, so
truthfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you wish to modify or alter anything I have written
down here, I will come and take any fresh statement you
may wish to make. You understand that perjury is a most
serious criminal offence?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>On the arrest of a man for murder he is taken before
the magistrates at the earliest possible opportunity,
but only to be formally charged—that is, evidence of arrest
is given, and a remand, generally for a week, is asked for
and obtained.</p>

<p class='c008'>During that long week Dr. Maclean was the least unhappy
of the unhappy inmates of Bonnie Doon because he was
forced to follow his profession. The fact that Harry Garlett—it
was taken as a fact—had poisoned his wife for love
of Jean Bower did not prevent men and women in the neighbourhood
falling ill and sending for the doctor. Indeed,
quite a number of his old patients suddenly developed some
kind of slight complaint in order that he or she might have
the intense satisfaction of a short talk with Jean Bower’s
uncle.</p>

<p class='c008'>At first Dr. Maclean had keenly resented these strange
manifestations of inquisitive human nature, and he dreaded
the questions which he knew would be put to him. But
after two or three days he became quite accustomed to the
usual opening:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dr. Maclean, I hope you won’t be offended if I say how
very, very sorry I feel for you and for Mrs. Maclean over
this terrible Garlett business. I hardly like to ask you what
you <i>really</i> think about Harry Garlett, but you and I are such
old friends I’m sure you won’t mind my asking?”</p>

<p class='c008'>From the first he had taken up a line to which he steadfastly
adhered: “I should much like to tell you my theories—but
if I am to be a witness next week, when Mr. Garlett is
brought up before the magistrates, it would not only be
unprofessional but very wrong for me to say anything at all
to you about the case.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As was only natural, nine times out of ten, the lady—for
it was generally a lady who asked him the indiscreet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>question—afterward told her husband, her friends, and her
acquaintances, that Dr. Maclean, though he was too kind
to say so, undoubtedly believed Harry Garlett guilty, for the
simple reason that had he thought Garlett innocent there
was no reason in the world why he should not have said so
right out.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if Dr. Maclean found it far from easy to put off his
patients, his real trouble in connection with the painful
mystery with which all their hearts were filled was with his
one-time happy home.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean Bower’s eyes followed him about as a dog’s eyes
follow his master. She never actually asked him to declare
his belief in her lover’s innocence, yet he always felt that she
was asking him, mutely, for some such declaration.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last, feeling he could bear her speechless interrogation
no longer, he put his arm round her shoulder and said very
quietly: “It’s no good, Jean! I’m an honest man, and I
can’t deceive you. I would like with all my heart to feel
sure that Harry is absolutely innocent, but the truth is I can’t
make up my mind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As for Mrs. Maclean, she longed to talk the whole matter
out with Jean, but her Scotch reserve kept her silent. Even
Elsie said nothing, but more than once Jean heard her administer
a vigorous, well-directed snub at some one who
tried to engage her in conversation at the back door on what
had now become the forbidden subject at Bonnie Doon.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if that strange, unnatural silence was preserved in
Dr. Maclean’s house, that was not the case anywhere else.
Within a circuit of thirty miles round, Harry Garlett and his
affairs were discussed constantly, and that by men and
women of every class and kind, of every social position, of
every degree of poverty and wealth. Strange rumours flew
hither and thither, some of them absurdly false.</p>

<p class='c008'>One fact gradually emerged. Little by little it became
known that no arsenic had been traced to the possession of
the man now lying under remand in Grendon prison. This
was the missing link in the chain of circumstantial evidence
which, it was beginning to be believed, would certainly in the
end hang the famous cricketer. Meanwhile, not only the
local papers, but the great London papers had become busy
over the case. Harry Garlett’s special interest in life, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>wonderful cricketing records, his popularity, his character as
an employer, everything and anything that touched on his
personality, was made the subject of comment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Often during that long week Jean Bower felt as though
she had fallen into a bath of ill-smelling mud from whose
stains she would never be wholly cleansed. British law considers
a man innocent until he is proved guilty, but it is
amazing what the English language can do in the way of
innuendo, and that without in any way sailing too near the
dangerous law of libel.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Half way through that terrible week of waiting suspense
there came to Jean one happy hour. Dr. Maclean had insisted
that the girl should go out with him, if only to get a
little fresh air, and they were both coming in tired from a
long round when they saw Elsie’s face at the kitchen window.
Before the doctor had time to jump out of his two-seater she
was at the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Kentworthy has arrived, sir. He’s with the mistress
in the dining room. She has given him some tea. He’s fair
longing to see you and Miss Jean!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Toogood would have been surprised had he seen how
utterly the girl who now walked quickly forward into the
dining room of Bonnie Doon had changed in looks from the
sad, listless, pale young creature to whom he had delivered
her lover’s message a few days before. Mr. Kentworthy
grasped her hand warmly and his eyes twinkled as he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve got up from my sick-bed in spite of my wife’s protests.
I said to Mrs. Kentworthy, ‘Now, this is just the
sort of job I’m going to enjoy thoroughly—clearing an innocent
man of a foul charge’—for that’s what we’re going to
do, Miss Bower. We may have a difficult task before us,
but there are already several very important points in our
favour.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” chimed in Mrs. Maclean, “Mr. Kentworthy has
been telling me that the Crown, in spite of the limitless
money at their disposal, have failed to trace any arsenic to
Harry’s possession. But I’m astonished to hear that there’s
arsenic in almost everything in use. Did you know that?”
She turned to her husband.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“Of course I did,” he answered curtly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Even in chocolate,” went on Mrs. Maclean, with a touch
of excitement. “Every chocolate manufacturer has a certain
amount of arsenic allowed him by the Government—so
much per ton of chocolate.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s why it’s lucky for us, my dear madam, that Mr.
Garlett made china instead of sweets,” exclaimed the private
detective, smiling. “And now,” he said, turning to Dr. Maclean,
“I suppose we must get down to business. Shall we
go into your study, sir? I have got your former statement
to me here. We must go over the whole thing again,
and I want you to put your mind to telling me anything—however
small or apparently unimportant—that may be of
value to us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But in spite of skilful cross-examination and shrewd suggestive
questioning, the hour which followed in Dr. Maclean’s
consulting room yielded little or no fresh material for
Mr. Kentworthy to work upon, and at last he said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder, sir, if you would mind my seeing Miss Bower
alone? She is more likely to talk frankly to me if there
are none of her family present.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean looked dubious.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t believe that would be the case with my niece,” he
replied. “But it shall be as you wish, Mr. Kentworthy.
Talk to the girl frankly—as frankly as you have talked to
me. For one thing she deserves frankness.” He added, in
a rather shamefaced voice, “I take it, Mr. Kentworthy, that
you still feel an unshaken belief in Garlett’s innocence?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The detective allowed a moment to pass by before he
answered, but at last his words came out clearly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do believe in Mr. Garlett’s innocence. But to err is
human, and I shall be able to tell you more as to what I really
think and feel after I have made fresh investigations. I’d
like, for instance, to have a talk with that Miss Cheale. You
never know in a case of this sort who may give you a valuable
clue. I take it she will be on our side?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean hesitated, a fact which was duly registered by
Kentworthy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think Miss Cheale will be able to add much to our
knowledge.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose the fact has occurred to you, doctor, that this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>young lady—I mean Miss Cheale—had a certain interest in
Mrs. Garlett’s death? She was left, I understand, a thousand
pounds.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but she was receiving three hundred pounds a year,
and all found,” was the quick answer. “Besides, I feel convinced
that she knew nothing of that legacy. It took us all,
even Mr. Garlett, entirely by surprise.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He went to the door and called out: “Jean! Mr. Kentworthy
is ready to see you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Pale, but absolutely composed, the girl came in. “Mr.
Kentworthy would prefer to see you alone,” said Dr. Maclean.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should prefer that also, Uncle Jock.”</p>

<p class='c008'>After her uncle had left the room there came a pathetic
eagerness into her manner. She knew that James Kentworthy
believed in her lover’s innocence, and she also knew,
though she would have scarcely admitted it even to herself,
that very few people shared that belief.</p>

<p class='c008'>But though they discussed at length every detail of the
story, he soon became aware that Jean had nothing to say
that threw any light on the mystery.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You suspect no one?” he asked at last, looking at her
rather hard. “There is no secret thought lying at the back
of your mind?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” she answered very gravely. “I suspect no one,
and, what is more, I know Mr. Garlett does not either.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Kentworthy gave her a long, measuring look. He was
wondering whether she could be trusted with a secret.
Finally he made up his mind that he would run the risk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did Dr. Maclean tell you what first caused the Home
Office to take action?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He doesn’t know!” she exclaimed. “Only the other
day my aunt was saying she’d give anything to find out what
had caused those first inquiries as to Mrs. Garlett’s death.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your uncle is a man of his word,” said the detective
briefly. “I myself told him what started the whole business,
but I made him promise not to pass the knowledge on.
However, I’m now going to tell you the secret, and I must
ask you to make me the same promise that he made me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked at him with wide-open eyes, and then he said
in a hesitating voice:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“Mr. Garlett has some bitter enemy, some one who, as
soon as the news of his forthcoming marriage to you had
begun to leak out in the neighbourhood, formed, as I believe,
an infamous plot to bring him to disgrace.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A bitter enemy?” faltered Jean.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, a bitter enemy, to my mind certainly a woman, who
wrote the three anonymous letters which led indirectly to the
exhumation of Mrs. Emily Garlett.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As she stared at him, overwhelmed with horror and dismay,
he laid before her on her uncle’s writing table the three
sinister sheets of paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“By rights I ought not to have kept these facsimiles in my
possession. But I made up my mind that it would be right
for me to keep even that which does not belong to me—if it
will help me to save an innocent man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean gazed down at the first impersonal note, that in
which the writer said he felt it his duty to draw the attention
of the Head Commissioner of Police to “certain mysterious
circumstances surrounding the death of Mrs. Garlett.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“This,” she said doubtfully, “was perhaps written by some
one who really thought there should have been an inquest?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Kentworthy shook his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are too kind, my dear young lady. Look at No. 2.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But surely this letter was not written by the same person
who wrote the first one?” exclaimed Jean, as she gazed at
the second, ill-written, comma-less letter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, as she read it over, she grew deeply red. Indeed,
she felt as if the words: “The doctor’s niece can tell you
why poor Mrs. Garlett’s doctor made no fuss,” had been
burnt, with a hot iron, for ever on the tablets of her memory.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now look at No. 3—that which purports to be written by
the sender of the first letter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She read over the long sentence, and then a look of bewilderment
and pain struggled together in her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” asked the detective gravely, “have you any suspicion
at all as to who wrote these letters?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She knitted her forehead and remained silent for quite a
long time, and James Kentworthy’s hopes rose high.</p>

<p class='c008'>But at last: “I have no suspicion,” said Jean Bower slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your uncle thought that they might be the work of that
Miss Prince, who lives in the Thatched Cottage.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>“I’m sure not,” said Jean, shaking her head. “Miss
Prince is a spiteful woman, and she has never liked Harry,
but she’s not a fiend.”</p>

<p class='c008'>James Kentworthy looked at her with increased respect.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I agree,” he said, “it’s never any use trying to convince
oneself of what, deep at the back of one’s mind, one knows is
not the case. But I won’t conceal from you that I’m disappointed!
Somehow I hoped you would be able to help me,
Miss Bower, and now I feel as if we were up against a blank
wall.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She said nothing, for she felt terribly oppressed—the
knowledge that there was some one in the world who intensely
hated both Harry Garlett and herself filled her with
a kind of unreasoning terror.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not giving up hope, mind you,” went on Kentworthy.
“We’ve a long time before us yet, and after all”—he was
now speaking as if to himself—“we’re lucky to have secured
Sir Harold Anstey.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean’s lip quivered. She felt as if, in spite of his brave
words, he was beginning to believe that he was confronted
with an unfathomable mystery.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sir Harold and I are old friends,” went on the detective
with a queer smile. “Thanks to me, a murderer Sir Harold
was bent on getting off was hung. So there’s no love lost
between us! Still, he’s a tower of strength with a jury—makes
them see black’s white, so to speak.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you think that will be necessary?” she asked in a
trembling voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think Sir Harold will start some queer theory of his
own—such as that the poor lady may have poisoned herself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That won’t be the truth,” said Jean.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And when you are in the witness-box it will be very
pleasant for you, Miss Bower—very pleasant, I mean, that
Sir Harold will be with you, and not against you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Garlett means to go into the box,” said Jean quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know he does,” said the other, “and I’m sorry for it.
It’s an unfair thing that any man now standing on trial for
his life has to go into the box or be considered guilty! Why,
it’s a monstrous thing in a way. Those who changed the
law never thought it would be like that.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“I don’t understand,” she exclaimed, bewildered. “Why
shouldn’t he go into the box?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because, Miss Bower, he’ll be up against people very
much cleverer than himself, if you’ll forgive me for saying
so—people, too, who’ll be keen and resourceful, while he’ll
be nervous and dejected. Now take one thing”—he looked
at her hard, hesitated in his own mind, then determined
that he would go through with what he felt ought to be said—“Mr.
Garlett will be asked when he first began to feel for you
those—well—sentiments that led to his asking you to be his
wife? If he is an absolutely honest man I expect he will
feel compelled to answer that he was attached to you long
before anybody else knew that he was. That will look pretty
bad from our point of view. <i>Motive</i>, Miss Bower—that’s
what judge, jury, everybody in a word, is always looking
for in a murder mystery. And <i>you</i> would provide a very
strong motive—if you take my meaning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He saw her face change. It was as if all the colour was
ebbing out of it. He suddenly regretted that he had been
so frank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is there anything I can do to help?” she asked piteously.</p>

<p class='c008'>He shook his head regretfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose it wouldn’t be any good my seeing Sir Harold
Anstey?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Kentworthy remained silent for a moment, and then
he answered in a rather singular tone:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think it would be a good thing for you to see him,
Miss Bower. But, mind you—it would be irregular—very
irregular! Mr. Toogood wouldn’t lend himself to anything
of that sort.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you think it would help Mr. Garlett, I’d manage to
see Sir Harold Anstey somehow,” she exclaimed, the colour
coming back into her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I expect you would. But——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what?” she said eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shouldn’t like it to be known that I advised your doing
such a thing. It isn’t my business to advise what isn’t
proper,” he said irresolutely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You haven’t advised it,” she exclaimed. “The moment
I heard that Sir Harold was going to defend Harry I made
up my mind to see him.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“Between you and me,” went on the worthy man, “it has
always seemed to me to be dashed stupid that the advocate
who is going to defend a man accused of a serious crime isn’t
allowed to see him! In this case it might make a real difference,
for if Mr. Garlett convinced <i>me</i> of his innocence, who’d
gone to see him feeling pretty sure he was guilty, then think
of the effect seeing him might have on a man who wants to
think him innocent?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t I persuade Sir Harold to see Harry?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The detective gave a short barklike laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sir Harold won’t see Mr. Garlett till they’re both in
court, and one of them in the dock!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean covered her eyes with her hand, but that made her
see all the more clearly the awful picture conjured up by
Mr. Kentworthy’s words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, Miss Bower. If you will keep your word
you’ll never let Sir Harold know how you obtained them,
I’ll give you these anonymous letters to show him. I’m
sure the Prosecution don’t mean to produce those letters.
’Twould put people off writing to the police if they thought
their letters would be put in among the exhibits.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Exhibits?” echoed Jean, “what are they?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Exhibits are the actual, concrete objects connected with
the case,” explained Kentworthy. “If you show Sir Harold
these letters he may demand that the originals be ‘put in,’ as
they call it. That will add a useful touch of mystery—and
he’ll make the most of it, never fear!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I’m to leave these facsimile letters with him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed you’re to do nothing of the kind! If we have
the good luck to run across their writer we may be very
glad of them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How soon ought I to try to see Sir Harold?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“As soon as I hear Sir Harold is back at work I’ll wire to
you: ‘Have hopes of a clue.’ But look here, Miss Bower.
If I were you I’d tell no one of what you mean to do, for
it’s irregular—very irregular! If the case were reversed, if
you were a gentleman and not a young lady, I’d never advise
you to try to see Sir Harold. But I think he’ll see <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Harold was what is known in common parlance as a
ladies’ man. But somehow the detective felt it best to leave
Jean Bower to discover that fact for herself.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>“I’m frightened about Jean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean looked across at his wife. “How d’you
mean?” he asked irritably. “Explain yourself, woman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I sent her upstairs to lie down after Mr. Kentworthy
had gone away, and about tea-time Elsie went up to see if
she was asleep. But she wasn’t in her room. We looked
all over the house, but she’s slipped out without telling anybody.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well? What of that? Why shouldn’t the girl want a
breath of fresh air? It’s just what I should have done at
her age if I’d felt as I’m afraid the poor wean is feeling
now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Listen to what she did do,” said Mrs. Maclean in a low
voice. “Elsie felt uneasy—just as uneasy as I did. So she
went off into the village. They said at the post office that
Jean had gone by, walking very quickly, about a quarter of
an hour before. Then Elsie—the woman’s no fool, Jock—somehow
guessed what the child had done!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“D’you mean she went to the Thatched House?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean could not keep the dismay out of his voice.
He knew that the police were still in charge of Harry Garlett’s
dwelling-place.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She went to the churchyard. Elsie found her close to
poor Mrs. Garlett’s grave. She was kneeling there, on the
bare, wet ground, and when Elsie came up close behind her
she heard her say: ‘Don’t be angry with Harry, Mrs. Garlett.
He hardly knew I existed while you were alive. But
I’ll give him up—I will, indeed, if you’ll help to save him?’
The poor girl screamed when Elsie spoke to her. But she
got up off the cold earth, and came back with Elsie. She’s
sitting in the dining room now, but she looks very strange,
and when I spoke to her just now she didn’t seem to hear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor looked alarmed. “She’s got it in her head
that she may have said something to the man who took her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>statement that will injure Garlett. She let out as much
to me yesterday. I did my best to reassure her, but I found
it damned difficult to do so, beyond saying that if the man’s
innocent nothing she said could affect the issue.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish I could think that,” said his wife significantly,
“I used to believe that an innocent man was never found
guilty, but I don’t know that I think so now, Jock.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Does that mean,” asked the doctor quickly, “that you
now think Garlett is innocent?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am more inclined to think him so than you are. For
one thing, Mr. Kentworthy’s belief in him has impressed me
very much.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Has Jean said anything to you about her talk with Kentworthy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” said Mrs. Maclean; “in a way, she’s been quite
mysterious about it, but I’m afraid she was terribly disappointed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose she’s sleeping badly?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She looked this morning as if she’d had no sleep at all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean got up; he came over to where his wife was
sitting and patted her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To-day I received a sample of a new preparation of
bromide and valerian with just a dash of chloral. I’ll try
Jean with that to-night, and if it gives her a good night I’ll
wire to London for a bottle of the stuff to come down by
train parcel to-morrow. We’ve got to keep her going these
next few weeks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve such a horror of drugs,” said Mrs. Maclean in a low
voice. “I thought you had, too, Jock?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So I have, but it’s quite an exceptional case. For the
matter of that, I only wish I could send the poor child to
sleep till the whole of this painful business is over. I’ve
sometimes thought what a fine thing it will be when science
is able to suspend a man’s thinking faculties for a much
longer period than for just a few hours——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t want to live in that time,” said Mrs. Maclean
stubbornly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I daresay you don’t, but a good many people would
be thankful to be able to take a dose of—shall we say
‘forgetfulness?’—through their worst time of sorrow, and, above
all, of anxiety.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>“Has any one spoken to you of the case to-day?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Every one has spoken to me of it! I was even stopped
in the road three or four times, and not very far from our
gate I had quite a talk with a newspaper man—in fact I
wonder Jean and Elsie didn’t meet him. He admitted he’d
been hanging about all the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They did meet him—he said he came from the biggest
of the London press agencies. But of course they hurried
indoors and refused to have anything to say to him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He almost persuaded me that it would be worth our
while to let Jean give him an interview,” observed the doctor
hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I disagree,” she said emphatically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, the question won’t arise now, for I told the man
right out she would give no statement to the press at
all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If only she would go away,” moaned Mrs. Maclean.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think she might—if you were to tell her that you simply
can’t bear staying here in the circumstances, and that you
will go with her,” said Dr. Maclean slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>As only answer his wife burst into sudden, sharp, short
sobs.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, what’s the matter?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t do it, Jock.” She was trying hard to regain
her composure. “You mustn’t ask it of me! I don’t feel
I can leave home just now. I know that my unhappiness
is nothing to that poor child’s, but still, I am very unhappy.”
The tears were running down her cheeks. “I suppose we’ve
been very fortunate,” she sobbed, “more fortunate than I
knew. Well, we’re paying for it now!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’ll be all the same a hundred years hence,” he said
lamely, “cheer up, woman!” And Mrs. Maclean wiped her
eyes and did try to cheer up.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>It is two o’clock in the morning, the darkest hour of the
winter night, and Jean Bower is dreaming. In what she
would describe as “a sort of a way” she knows she is dreaming,
and yet, even so, she is filled with an awful sensation of
foreboding and affright.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this strange and terrific dream of hers, Bonnie Doon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>is transformed into a citadel. She is in an upper room,
and, gazing fearfully out of the window, she sees a mob of
men surging round the pretty, old-fashioned, creeper-covered
house standing so defenceless close to the road leading from
Terriford village to Grendon. The assaulters are trying to
force their way inside the house. She can hear the roar
of triumph when one of them thinks he has obtained a foothold
on the trellis work, and the murmur of disappointment
and exasperation when one of them falls back.</p>

<p class='c008'>She knows with a sure and dreadful knowledge that they
are all trying to get at her, and she begins running from room
to room trying to hide herself. But this only means a new
horror—for into whatever room she runs there is always a
window, and against that window she sees pressed menacing,
grimacing faces.</p>

<p class='c008'>And yet, even so, one part of her drugged brain tells her
that this fearful adventure is only a dream—a dream induced
by what Elsie told her about the three reporters whose faces
were pressed against the kitchen window on the morning
after the arrest of Harry Garlett. Her uncle had warned
her that what had happened that morning would probably
occur again and again....</p>

<p class='c008'>At last, with a sobbing sensation of relief, she awakes and
sits up in bed. What was it woke her? The sound, which
seemed infinitely far away, of a window opening and shutting?</p>

<p class='c008'>Again she lies down, and soon she has gone back to that
strange land of dreams that has always played such a part
in her life. But this time it is to a happy dreamland, and to
her weary, bemused brain the knowledge brings with it a
vague comfort. Anything is better than real life just now.</p>

<p class='c008'>A dream-match has been struck close to her face, and a
dream-man’s voice—a low, pleasant, caressing voice—exclaims
soothingly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be frightened, little girl; it’s only a friend who
wants to help you and your lover.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A friend? A real friend who wants to help her and
Harry? How wonderful! Even though she knows it is
only a dream-friend, the kind deep voice brings comfort,
and a measure of reassurance, to her oppressed heart. So
she answers in a low, sleepy voice:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“How can you help us? I don’t think any one can help
us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As she mutters the words the light flickers out, and she is
again in darkness. But out of the darkness there again
comes that drawling, caressing voice:</p>

<p class='c008'>“We—you and I—have this in common, Miss Jean. You
believe in Harry Garlett’s innocence, and I know he is innocent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She answers dreamily, “I know it, too. I more than believe,
I <i>know</i> that Harry is innocent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And from her unseen friend there come again brave, comforting
words:</p>

<p class='c008'>“We must put our wits together, and think of something
that will make other people believe him innocent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t think of anything,” she says wearily, “can you?
Oh, do try, dream-friend!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She finds it so delicious to be lulled by that deep, caressing
voice, even though she knows it is only a dream-voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you never thought that Mrs. Garlett might have
taken the poison herself?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She answers, as if hypnotized: “Do you think so?” and
quickly the answer comes back out of the darkness: “Why
not? There’s only one thing worth having in life—and that
one thing the poor soul lacked.”</p>

<p class='c008'>One thing worth having? What can he mean? Jean is
losing hold of herself, she is beginning to feel extraordinarily
drowsy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The one thing worth having in this queer life of ours is
love,” whispers the tender, mocking voice. “Mrs. Garlett
had no love in her life, and even she must have known that
life is not worth living without love.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean murmurs: “What brings happiness is to love, not to
be loved.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, as if the familiar words were being uttered infinitely
far away, she hears—“Out of the mouths of babes
and sucklings——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the voice comes nearer, it is close to her ear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Before I go back, far, far away, to the land of dreams,
I have a message for you, Miss Jean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A message, dream-friend?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A message from Harry Garlett’s soul to yours. He asks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>you to remember that ‘stone walls do not a prison make,
nor iron bars a cage.’ He says he feels happy—happy in
spite of all that has happened—because he possesses your
love.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then the voice becomes infinitely sad: “There is no
love where I live—in Goblin Land—only an ugly imitation
of love. Still, even an ugly imitation of the greatest thing
in the world is better than no love at all,” and there is something
so mournful, so hopeless in the voice that utters those
words that Jean feels keenly distressed. Were she not so
drowsy the tears would come into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hobgoblins, strange and horrible shapes of pain and
death, haunt my dwelling-place,” goes on her dream-friend.
“True there is no unjust judge, no stupid, conceited set of
jurymen, but as a terrible set-off to that relief there is no rapture—or
none to speak of—in the land of dreams. You and
Harry Garlett have the best of it, even now, in the waking
world, Miss Jean. And now, dream happy dreams, poor
child, happy, happy dreams....”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The next morning but one Elsie was bustling about her
kitchen, but ever since she had seen those pallid faces pressed
against the window-pane she had left the shutters closed till
after breakfast.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon there came the sound of milk cans jingling against
one another, so she hurried into the scullery and cautiously
unlocked the back door.</p>

<p class='c008'>The milkman looked so cheerful that Elsie felt irritated.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re later than usual,” she said snappily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I stopped to ’ave a read of the paper. ’Tis rare exciting
to-day.” He added with a chuckle: “I’m in it this morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You!” exclaimed Elsie. She thought he had gone mad.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s my picture in it, as well as my name—just because
I ’aves the honour of leaving the milk ’ere each morning,”
he said grinning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he waited for a second. Though they were old
friends he was slightly afraid of the tall Scotswoman who
now stood looking at him with an air of disgust and doubt
on her strong features.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re in it, too,” he said at last, enjoying with a somewhat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>fearful joy the look of wrath that flamed up into her
face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Me in it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You and me is on the back page. Right in the middle
where they prints the big news there’s a piece as what they
calls a statement about your young lady——”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then he handed her the paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>She opened it wide and saw that on the middle sheet, under
a photograph of Bonnie Doon, ran the words in huge
letters:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div>BY AN OLD FRIEND</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Jean’s not given any statement,” said Elsie fiercely.
“It’s all a lie, from beginning to end.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, you just read what’s there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope the doctor will have the law on this dratted
paper. I never heard of such a thing. How dare they?”
she cried indignantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>But she was rapidly reading the short double-column,
large-print article, and as she did so she was impressed in
spite of herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Every man, woman and child in Terriford village will tell you that
Jean Bower, the sweet-faced heroine of what promises to be one of
the big murder mysteries of our time, is a simple, gentle-natured
girl with an exceptionally kind and feeling heart for those in any
sorrow or distress. That is why the hearts of all her neighbours,
gentle and simple, go out to her in the terrible and overwhelming
sorrow which has come to her.</p>

<p class='c010'>While utterly refusing to be interviewed by any pressmen, I have
had the privilege, as one of her oldest friends, to have a short talk
with her on the subject of what has come to be called the Terriford
Mystery.</p>

<p class='c010'>Through me she is willing to let it be known that she is absolutely
convinced of Harry Garlett’s innocence. Further, she is inclined to
believe that Mrs. Garlett, a bedridden invalid, who was known
to have attacks of depression at times, administered the poison to
herself!</p>

<p class='c010'>The very fact that Mrs. Garlett was so deeply attached to her
husband would of itself provide a motive to some of those who were
acquainted with the poor lady. Among those acquaintances, however,
Miss Jean Bower was not, for it is a curious fact that she had
never even seen Mrs. Garlett.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Furthermore, her old friend can emphatically deny the cruel and
stupid rumours that declare her to have been on friendly terms with
Mr. Garlett before his wife’s death. Owing to a series of circumstances
that will be made clear by the defence, Miss Bower, though
actually in the employment of the Etna China Company, was only on
the most distant terms with the company’s managing director.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Elsie read on her first feeling of anger and disgust
was insensibly transformed into one of satisfaction, though
she frowned, or tried to frown, when, after a laudatory account
of Bonnie Doon, of Dr. Maclean and of his wife, she
came to the following paragraphs:</p>

<p class='c010'>Last, and by no means least, in the group of people who compose
this typical British household of worthy and high-minded folk, is
Elsie MacTaggart, the cook.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie is a clever, pugnacious Scotswoman, full of the mother wit
and tender, homely wisdom that we all associate with the land which
gave birth to J. M. Barrie. “It was a fair treat,” as one of those
who was present told me, “to hear Elsie dealing with the swarm of
reporters and press photographers that surrounded Bonnie Doon
the day after Harry Garlett was arrested!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Unlike the great majority of her brilliant fellow countrymen and
countrywomen, she showed no favour, even to those of the press
folk present who hailed from the other side of the Tweed. She held
the fort, so to speak, with fine discrimination and courage, and it is
largely thanks to her that no statement could be extracted even out
of Dr. Maclean.</p>

<p class='c010'>Elsie MacTaggart, in addition to her other gifts, is a splendid
cook, and those who have the good fortune to be bidden as guests to
Bonnie Doon all go home feeling utterly dissatisfied with their own
porridge and griddle cakes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a havering idiot the man seems to be!” said Elsie
at last.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some there are as believe as what Mrs. Cole-Wright
wrote that piece,” observed the milkman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never!” exclaimed Elsie. “She’s far too proud a body
to demean herself by writing for a newspaper. This is a
man’s work—unless I’m much out of my reckoning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe it’s the Reverend Cole-Wright.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, ’tisn’t him neither,” said Elsie decidedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her quick mind was darting hither and thither. She felt
genuinely puzzled, and then there came to her a sudden
illumination.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s that fat Kentworthy!” she exclaimed, remembering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>that Mr. Kentworthy had highly approved of the bountiful
tea which had been spread out in his honour. Also, now that
she came to think of it, he had said that he liked Scotch cakes
owing to his mother having been a Scotswoman. Well, well,
the world’s a small place!</p>

<p class='c008'>Elsie took her old worn leather purse out of her pocket.
“I’d like to keep this paper,” she observed. “Here’s a
penny, milkman, for you to get yourself another one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can keep the paper and your penny, too,” said the man
offended. “I never thought, Miss MacTaggart, good friends
though we may be, that you’d take me for a Scotsman!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Locking the scullery door, Elsie went back into her kitchen,
and there she spread the newspaper out on the table, and once
more read the article through.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now Elsie never went into the village to do her daily shopping
without hearing Mrs. Garlett’s mysterious death discussed
from every point of view, but never once had any one
even so much as hinted that the late mistress of the Thatched
House had committed suicide.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again and again she now read over the words: “She is
inclined to believe that Mrs. Garlett, a bedridden invalid
who was known to have attacks of depression at times, administered
the poison to herself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This was, of course, the one solution that would make them
all happy again!</p>

<p class='c008'>So it was with a look of real happiness on her thin, intelligent
face that she took the paper into the dining room just
after the doctor and his wife had sat down to breakfast.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s something just here,” she exclaimed, “that I
doubt whether you’ll approve, doctor. But I’m thinking it
will make you happy all the same.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Without waiting for an answer, she went out of the room,
and Mrs. Maclean jumped from her chair and came round to
where her husband, an air of astonishment on his face, was
staring with angry, disgusted eyes at the picture of Bonnie
Doon. Then, together, they eagerly read the article which
purported to contain a statement by Jean Bower.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whoever do you think wrote this?” asked Mrs. Maclean
at last. “Of course there’s a lot in it that’s true, but I’d
stake my life that Jean hasn’t talked about this terrible business
to any human being. I know she has absolutely refused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>to discuss it with Miss Prince, though the woman’s been at
her again and again about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For a few moments Dr. Maclean remained silent. Half
mechanically he was reading over and over again the phrases
in the so-called statement that puzzled him the most.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then at last he looked up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is the work of a practised literary hand—maybe I
ought to say of a practised literary hack!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll tell you who I think did it, or maybe had it done,”
said Mrs. Maclean slowly. “I think ’twas that man Kentworthy
or someone he employed to write it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor struck his hand on the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ve got it, woman!” he cried. “Kentworthy did his
level best to force me to say that that poor creature, Emily
Garlett, had administered the poison to herself. This is the
red herring across the trail. Not a doubt of it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He sat back in his chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The more I know of law and lawyers, the more I feel
that what we call law and justice are queer, twisted things,”
he said in a low voice. “Perhaps Kentworthy has done the
best in the circumstances. At any rate, it’s not our job to
let him down or blame him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His wife shook her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To my mind no one is justified in putting words into
Jean’s mouth which she never uttered, and never will utter,”
she said firmly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are one of those old-fashioned people who believe
in telling the truth,” said the doctor dubiously. “I’d have
said the same of myself a month ago. Of course, you and I
know that that woman never committed suicide—the idea’s
absurd! Still, if they can’t get any better notion, that’s what
the defence will set out to prove—I can see that well enough.
I fear me I shall be asked the question straight out, if only
because of this foolish article.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And if you are asked the question straight out, what is
it you intend to say in answer, Jock?”</p>

<p class='c008'>They were both unheeding and uncaring of the good breakfast
which was fast getting cold, and instinctively they had
both lowered their voices for fear lest Jean, though they
believed her to be safe in bed, might suddenly open the door
on them.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“Well, Jenny, if I’m on oath, what can I say, except that
to the best of my belief the thought of suicide never crossed
Mrs. Garlett’s mind?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you have to put it quite as strongly as that?” asked
his wife.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I don’t say I shall put it quite as strongly as I’ve
put it to you, but still it’s the truth! Mrs. Garlett loved life,
for all she was such a poor, sickly thing. You must remember
that she had never been a strong and healthy woman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Mrs. Maclean so far forgot herself as to say
something which reduced her husband to silence.</p>

<p class='c008'>She went back to her place behind the teapot, and from
there, in a small, still voice, she said quietly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“You did make one mistake, Jock. You hadn’t a doubt
that the woman died a natural death, and you signed a
certificate to that effect. Isn’t it just possible that you’ve
made another mistake? Supposing, after all, Mrs. Garlett
had got tired of her life and made up her mind to quit?
Don’t you go and be too sure of anything, my dear. You
were wrong once; you may be wrong again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He made no answer to that, and though she loved him well,
and had no wish to hurt him, she would not have taken her
words back. What she had said was true—in this strange
world it is a mistake, sometimes a terrible mistake, to be too
sure of anything.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a while she spoke again:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wouldn’t let Jean know about this article, if we can
prevent it, Jock. She’s so fearsomely truthful. She might
think it her duty to write to the paper and say that she does
not believe Mrs. Garlett killed herself! I did raise the point
with her after Kentworthy came that first time, and she
declared that Harry Garlett told her his wife was much too
religious a woman ever to have thought of such a thing—apart
from the fact that she always seemed perfectly happy
and contented with her life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think you’re right. We’ll say nothing of it. What a
blessing it is that we can trust Elsie to hold her tongue!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And so it was that Dr. Maclean locked the paper away,
and that Jean Bower was never shown the article described
as containing her statement.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet the so-called statement was widely discussed, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>both the Prosecution and the Defence took special note of it.
Further, the circulation of the paper was very largely increased,
at any rate in Terriford and Grendon, during the
weeks which followed. Thus the enterprise the editor had
shown in securing the article was justified, though one of the
proprietors, when he discovered, as he took the trouble to do,
that the author was a casual contributor and had been paid
a special fee of fifty guineas, thought the sum excessive.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Miss Prince got up very early on the morning Harry
Garlett was to appear before the magistrates, to be
either committed for trial, or sent out into the world a free
man.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though glad, in a sense, that her friend Agatha Cheale
had been saved by illness from the painful ordeal of appearing
against her late employer, she, Miss Prince, felt, from a
selfish point of view, sorry. For it had been arranged, at
Agatha Cheale’s own request, that the older woman should
accompany her to the police court, and Miss Prince had a
special reason for wishing to know what exact evidence as
to the arsenic, the administration of which had undoubtedly
killed Mrs. Garlett, would be tendered to-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>As things had now fallen out, she would have to possess
her soul in patience till the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be asked why Miss Prince did not follow the example
of innumerable women belonging to the neighbourhood,
that is, go off to Grendon and, after a more or less
long wait, fight her way into the police court? Had she
been thirty years younger she might have done so, but being
the manner of woman she was, the thought of doing so
unladylike and bold a thing never even occurred to her.
And yet, during the whole of the wakeful night which preceded
her early rising, her mind was entirely occupied with
the form the evidence against Harry Garlett was likely to
assume.</p>

<p class='c008'>As is the case with most clever, malicious gossips, no
woman could on occasion keep her own counsel more rigidly
than could Miss Prince. No doubt this was owing, in a
measure, to the fact that for more than half her life she had
been the trusted confidante of her father. In no profession
is there so high a standard of loyalty to another’s personal
secrets as in the medical profession, and what is true of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>doctor is generally true also of the doctor’s wife and daughter.</p>

<p class='c008'>So it was that Miss Prince had kept rigidly to herself a
dreadful suspicion which since the arrest of Harry Garlett
had hardened into certainty.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lucy Warren, hearing her mistress stirring, had hurried
down to cook the breakfast, and Miss Prince, leaving her
cold bedroom, felt a certain warmth about the heart as there
floated up her tiny staircase a pleasant aroma of frizzling
bacon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Worried and unhappy as she felt, uncertain, too, as to
where her duty lay—a most unusual feeling with her—she
yet told herself that she was indeed fortunate in her good,
quiet, sensible young servant. Even as a child Lucy Warren
had been a favourite of hers, and the girl seemed so superior
to her class, so reserved, so proud, that for a moment Miss
Prince asked herself whether she would not do well to
confide in Lucy, for she longed to share her anxiety and
uncertainty with some other human being. But the thought
was no sooner there than she dismissed it, aware that if the
moment came when she felt she must share her secret, it was
to a lawyer that a certain fact, known to her alone, must be
admitted.</p>

<p class='c008'>But one thing she did this morning marked both to herself
and to Lucy Warren the unusual nature of the day. She
ordered her breakfast, for the first time in her life, to be
brought to her upstairs sitting room. Perhaps because it
was upstairs, she very seldom used this room, except when
she asked a few friends in to supper and a game of cards.
From her point of view, though she would not have admitted
it, the upstairs sitting room of the Thatched Cottage was a
cardroom and nothing else.</p>

<p class='c008'>She sat down, feeling deadly cold, for though the fire was
burning brightly the room was chilly, as a room in which no
fire has been lit for some days is apt to be. But it was not
the cold which made Miss Prince feel so shivery, and so
miserably undecided in her mind. For the first time in her
now long life she was confronted with a problem to which
she could see no solution that would not bring disaster, even
death, in its train.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lucy Warren came up with her mistress’s breakfast tray.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>She drew up a small table and set it before her in silence,
making no remark, as almost any other young woman would
have done, as to Miss Prince’s surprising choice of a breakfast
room, and she was just leaving the room when her mistress
called out: “Lucy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lucy turned round. “Yes, ma’am?” she said inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Always Miss Prince insisted on being accorded brevet
rank both by her own servants and the people of the village.
She hated the term “Miss.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come nearer, Lucy. I want to speak to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, somewhat to Miss Prince’s astonishment, she
saw that her words startled the girl. Lucy became painfully
red, as she stood before her mistress twisting and untwisting
a bit of apron in her hand, and looking very unlike her usual
composed self.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want you to cast your mind back to last April and May—I
mean, of course, when your friend Agnes Dean was
my servant. You used to be in and out of my kitchen a
good deal, I think.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lucy answered freely, eagerly: “Yes, ma’am, I used to
come along most days.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now I want to ask you a very serious question, Lucy,
and I rely on you to keep the fact that I have asked it of you
to yourself. Did she tell you, or were you aware of your
own knowledge, that Mr. Garlett was ever in this house at a
time when I was out of it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not that I know of, ma’am. The only person who used
sometimes to come and wait for you while you was out was
Miss Cheale.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, I know that,” Miss Prince spoke with a touch
of impatience. “What I want you to try to remember
is whether Mr. Garlett was ever in this house alone for, say,
a quarter of an hour? Especially, Lucy,” she hesitated,
then asked the question firmly, “whether he was ever in this
upper part of the house by himself? As you know, he is
my landlord. On him depend all the outside repairs. It is
possible, nay, even probable, he may have come upstairs
once or twice on such business as that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Garlett never bothered about that sort of thing himself,
ma’am. He always sent the builder along. A nice fat
lot of money Blackman has made out of that poor gentleman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>in the last ten years! Mr. Garlett never bothered, and
Mrs. Garlett was too ill to bother.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince looked fixedly at the girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you are not one of those,” she observed in a rather
cold tone, “who believe that Mr. Garlett poisoned Mrs.
Garlett?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lucy hesitated, and then she made a reply that surprised
Miss Prince.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t care one way or the other,” she said sullenly.
“Though it doesn’t seem to me that Mr. Garlett had any
reason to do such a wicked thing. It wasn’t as if he’d known
Miss Bower then—leastways he did know her, but he didn’t
like her. I know that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know that, Lucy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do, ma’am. I heard Mr. Garlett say one day, when I
was waiting at table, that he wished Mrs. Maclean hadn’t
gone and asked him to take her niece on at the factory. He
said it would be difficult to reprimand her—that was the
word he used—if she did anything that he or old Mr. Dodson
didn’t like. He said it was a mistake to mix up friendship
and business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whom did he say that to?” asked Miss Prince eagerly.
Here she was on her old familiar ground of gossip.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He said it to the lawyer, Mr. Toogood,” answered Lucy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Was that just before his wife’s death?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, ’twas perhaps a fortnight before she died. I can’t
say exactly. Miss Cheale had already gone upstairs, and
Mr. Garlett had rung for more port wine, and it was as I
came into the dining room that I heard him say that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dear me, that’s very interesting.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You won’t let on I’ve told you that, ma’am?” asked
Lucy earnestly. “Mother’s fearful lest I be mixed up in it
all. She was once called to an inquest and never forgot it.
It made her ill for months afterward, that it did—she was so
terrified. Those lawyers ’ud get anything out of you. They
make you say black’s white—and white’s black.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think there’s the slightest reason to fear that you
will be called as a witness,” said Miss Prince coldly, “and in
any case, if you were called, it would be your duty to attend,
Lucy. Surely you would think it a duty to speak up and
tell the truth?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>And then Lucy, emboldened by Miss Prince’s benignant
mood, ventured a question.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you be a witness, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I? Certainly not! Why should I be?” Miss Prince
looked disturbed—she even flushed a little. “Miss Cheale
will be a witness for the Prosecution, for she was with poor
Mrs. Garlett when she died.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Lucy said in a singular tone:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Cheale will be sorry if Mr. Garlett is hanged. She
was such a friend of his.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not only a friend,” said Miss Prince quickly, “but a
relation, too. Miss Cheale is a distant cousin of Mr. Garlett’s.
I’ve always supposed that that was why Mrs. Garlett
left her that legacy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lucy turned away, and perhaps it was as well that Miss
Prince did not see the look that came over her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lucy? One word more. Has your mother heard from
Mr. Guy Cheale lately? Does she know where he is, and
what he’s doing?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lucy did not turn round, as a properly trained servant
ought to have done.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mother heard from Mr. Cheale? Not that I know of.
Why should she?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she slipped out of the room and went down the stairs
at such a pace that her mistress concluded she must have
heard some one knocking at the back door.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince began eating her now cold egg and bacon.
She felt sick and shivery, yet she forced herself to eat, and
after a while the food and her good China tea made her feel
a little better. But even so she was in a miserable state of
uncertainty.</p>

<p class='c008'>With all her odious peculiarities she had a strict, if a
narrow, sense of duty, and she could not make up her mind
as to what she ought to do with regard to a sinister fact
known to herself alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince, for her misfortune, knew of a place in Terriford
where arsenic could be found. And deep in her heart
she was quite certain it was from that store or cache of
arsenic that had been stolen the dose of poison which had
killed Emily Garlett.</p>

<p class='c008'>That store or cache of arsenic was here, in her own house,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>close by where she was now considering the difficult problem
of what it was her duty to do.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sitting there, in front of the now bright fire, she could
visualize with horrid clearness the fat glass-stoppered bottle
with the red label on which was printed in black letters the
word “Arsenic.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The bottle—which contained a sufficient quantity of the
deadly poison to have killed every one in the village—stood
on the top shelf of her drug cupboard, in a tiny room next
door, known all over the village as “Miss Prince’s medicine
room.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As residuary legatee to her father, everything that had
belonged to him at his death had passed into her possession,
and she had chosen to take with her to her new home the
drugs that had been in his dispensary.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a country medical practice every little counts. Thanks
to Miss Prince, the poorer folk in Terriford had hardly ever
had occasion to consult Dr. Maclean. He had spoken to
her of the matter only once—years ago—soon after his arrival.
She had said what had been far more true then than
it was to-day—that the working folk were so miserably poor
that it would be sheer cruelty to ask them to send for the
doctor for every trifling ailment. Further, she had asserted
that often she relieved him of work for which he could never
expect any payment, and Dr. Maclean had admitted, somewhat
reluctantly, the force of the argument.</p>

<p class='c008'>But while the knowledge of that stoppered bottle on the
top shelf of the drug cupboard which she generally, but not
invariably, kept locked, made her feel acutely anxious, she
tried to persuade herself that it could not be her duty to
force herself into this, to her, horrible affair. Not only was
the thought of appearing in the witness-box at a great trial
terrible to one with Miss Prince’s old-fashioned feminine
outlook on life, but she was well aware that she would certainly
be severely censured, by both counsel and judge in
the case, for keeping such poisons as arsenic and strychnine
in her house.</p>

<p class='c008'>She faced the grim certainty that she, and she alone, could
supply the missing link in the chain of circumstantial evidence
now tightening around Harry Garlett. But would
that link be missed? Never having liked him, and having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>now no doubt as to his guilt, she equally had no doubt as to
his fate. Was it essential that she, his wife’s oldest friend,
should hound him to his death?</p>

<p class='c008'>She asked herself with a sharp feeling of self-rebuke why
she had been such a fool as to keep a poison which she never
had any reason to use? But there it was, she had kept it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Getting up at last, she took off a small bookshelf “The
Student’s Handbook of Forensic Medicine and Public
Health,” and turning to the entry “Metallic Irritants,” she
quickly made herself mistress of what information was there.</p>

<p class='c008'>She learned that white arsenic—that is the type of arsenic
in her possession—was not only colourless and odourless, but
almost devoid of taste, thus very easily administered in powdered
sugar, and even she, with her wide knowledge of
drugs, received a certain shock when she discovered that
a pinch of arsenic holds no less than seventeen grains, two
grains being a fatal dose.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now Miss Prince, in common with almost every one in
the neighbourhood, had severely blamed Dr. Maclean for
his lack of suspicion, but, as she read the little black volume
by which her father had set such store, she realized that the
old doctor had not been so much to blame after all. For,
whereas in many cases the symptoms of arsenical poisoning
point to an irritant administered, all sorts of anomalies may
and do occur. In fact the symptoms are frequently so misleading
that death due to the action of arsenic has even been
described as spontaneous internal inflammation!</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince put her book back on its shelf and went out on
the landing. She listened intently for a few moments, and
then, turning the handle of the door giving into her medicine
room, she went through into the tiny bare chamber.</p>

<p class='c008'>After having shut the door softly, she gazed at the substantial
wooden cupboard in which she kept the drugs which
were a survival of the days when she had been her father’s
faithful assistant and dispenser.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cupboard was locked now. But it had been often
left open till a few days ago—owing to the trifling fact
that something had gone wrong with the lock, and that it had
become just a little tiresome to turn the key.</p>

<p class='c008'>If only walls could speak! Miss Prince, gazing up at the
grained wood, would have given years of her life to know if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Harry Garlett had ever stood where she was standing now—but
with the cupboard doors wide open before him.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last, with an impatient movement, she took a step forward,
and stood by the narrow window of her medicine
room, and then, suddenly, she shrank back, and a deep frown
gathered on her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>Trudging quickly along in the wintry sunshine was James
Kentworthy, the man who had, to use her own expression,
bamboozled her. It was easy now to marvel at her stupidity
in supposing for a moment that such an individual could
have been connected, even very distantly, with her poor
friend, Emily Garlett. But she had believed him, absolutely,
and on the strength of it had asked him in to tea. Well
she remembered the quiet, skilful way in which he had examined
and cross-examined her concerning the inmates of
the Thatched House.</p>

<p class='c008'>James Kentworthy was on his way to Bonnie Doon, for it
had been arranged that he and the doctor should drive
together to Grendon in order to be present at the final inquiry
before the magistrates.</p>

<p class='c008'>The private inquiry agent felt, if possible, even more
baffled than he had been at the end of his conversation
with Jean Bower. He had learned everything there was
to learn, or so he felt convinced, concerning the only people
who had had access to Mrs. Garlett, and more and more it
had become clear to him that the only human being with
a paramount interest in her death was her husband, Harry
Garlett. Twenty years of hard work in the Criminal Investigation
Department had proved to him that where there
is no motive there is no murder, and if this be true of an
ordinary, sordid crime, how much more true when a secret
poisoner is in question!</p>

<p class='c008'>But Kentworthy was also aware of a fact which is often
forgotten by those interested in murder mysteries—namely,
that a motive which may seem utterly inadequate to one type
of mind, to another may be overwhelmingly sufficient for almost
any crime.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again and again he had asked himself, in the last few
days, what manner of woman was Agatha Cheale? Next
to Harry Garlett she was the only human being who had
benefited by Mrs. Garlett’s death. On the other hand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>the young lady had been in the enjoyment of a very exceptional
salary. For her apparently simple and easy services
she had been paid at the rate of three hundred pounds a year.
Further, Mr. Toogood had assured him that Mrs. Garlett,
secretive as are so many people concerning their money affairs,
had not even made the husband whom she dearly loved
acquainted with the terms of her will.</p>

<p class='c008'>All those men whose professions, be they lawyers, doctors,
ministers of the gospel, whose way of life brings them closely
in touch with human nature, soon become aware of how
difficult it is to form any accurate view concerning the
secret relations of a man and a woman. Mr. Kentworthy
had come to the reluctant conclusion that long before his
wife’s death Garlett had lived a double life. He was convinced
of the truth of Lucy Warren’s statement as to the
meetings in the wood, and the more convinced because the
girl had made it unwillingly, indeed had been frightened into
making it. Twice he had tried in the last three days to
get in touch with her again, each time choosing a moment
when Miss Prince was out. But Lucy Warren had defied
him, and the second time he had seen her she had said with
a shrewdness that surprised him:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am not bound to tell you anything now. It was different
when you came from the police.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Kentworthy was convinced that she had told the truth,
and so he accepted it as a fact that Garlett had been in the
habit of meeting a woman secretly at night. Further, he
believed that the anonymous letters had been written by
that unknown woman, and he hoped that her association
with Garlett—of whatever nature it might prove to be—would
provide a sufficiently strong motive for her to have
committed secret murder.</p>

<p class='c008'>With his mind full of these vague and uncertain half-suspicions,
the detective came within sight of Bonnie Doon,
and then he hastened his steps, for the doctor’s motor was
already before the door waiting to start for the police court
in Grendon where Harry Garlett’s fate was to be decided
to-day so far as it was within the power of the local magistrates
to decide it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Early that same afternoon Miss Prince made her way
to the rectory. She felt too anxious, too excited, too
restless to stay quietly at home, and she knew that the rector
would soon be returning with the news of what had happened.</p>

<p class='c008'>She and the rector’s wife, Mrs. Cole-Wright, were on
terms of armed neutrality rather than friendship, and that
though they “ran the parish” between them. Mrs. Cole-Wright
was the best-read woman in the neighbourhood. In
happier circumstances she might have cut a certain figure in
the world. As it was, her sarcastic tongue and reputation
for “cleverness” caused her to be avoided by many of her
neighbours.</p>

<p class='c008'>She shared to the full the prevailing excitement concerning
Harry Garlett, and so, for once, she was glad to see Miss
Prince.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The rector is not yet back,” she observed, “but you
must wait and hear what he has to say. I suppose that
unfortunate man has been committed for trial, though I
don’t quite see what actual evidence they have against
him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How d’you mean?” exclaimed the other, surprised.
“Surely you don’t doubt that poor Emily Garlett was poisoned?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I don’t doubt that,” answered Mrs. Cole-Wright
impatiently. “But I do ask myself how they will
be able to bring the murder home to Harry Garlett, unless
they can prove that he had arsenic in his possession, or that
he bought arsenic for any purpose whatsoever, within a
comparatively short time of his wife’s death.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think it’s almost certain that they did find some arsenic
in the Thatched House,” said Miss Prince. “But we shall
soon know——”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>She did not look up as she spoke; she kept her eyes fixed
on a worn spot in the rectory drawing-room carpet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even as she said the words there came the sound of the
front door opening and shutting, and a moment later the
rector came hurriedly into the room, almost as eager to tell
his news as they were to hear it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, it’s gone as I suppose we all expected it to do,”
he exclaimed. “Garlett has been committed for trial at
the next assizes on the charge of having murdered his wife!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did he take it?” asked his wife.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very oddly, to my thinking. The unhappy man addressed
the magistrates. Think of that! Why, he himself
was sitting on that very magistrate’s bench less
than a month ago——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What did he say?” exclaimed the two ladies together.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He only spoke for about three minutes—but it seemed
an hour to me! He declared most solemnly that he was
not guilty, and he made a kind of appeal—it made me go
hot all over—asking how it was possible that any one who
had ever known him could believe him guilty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Miss Prince looked into the rector’s kindly,
troubled face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did they find any arsenic at the Thatched House?” she
asked in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing was said about that,” answered the clergyman
slowly. “If any arsenic was found they have not chosen
to bring the fact forward to-day. Of course what told terribly
against Garlett was Maclean’s evidence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Had he anything new to say?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I don’t know that he had, exactly. But there was
quite a sensation in the court when he revealed that Mrs.
Garlett had taken a plateful of strawberries and sugar from
Harry Garlett’s own hand a few hours before the poor soul
died in agony! One could tell that according to Maclean’s
theory the arsenic was administered in the white powdered
sugar which seems to have been thickly sprinkled over the
strawberries.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My strawberries!” exclaimed Miss Prince, as if speaking
to herself, “my strawberries—alas!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They both turned on her quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Your</i> strawberries, Miss Prince? What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>“Ever since I was a girl,” she answered, “I have grown
a few forced strawberries each spring. I thought every one
in Terriford knew that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There came a spot of colour into her sallow face. She
had never presented the Cole-Wrights with a basket of her
forced strawberries, and now she regretted the omission.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you mean you grow them in pots in the house?”
asked Mrs. Cole-Wright, a touch of sarcasm in her voice.
She had no love of gardening—another peculiarity which
tended to make her unpopular with her neighbours.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I grow them there in two small barrels in which holes
have been pierced,” answered Miss Prince quickly. “A
French governess showed me how to do it when I was little
more than a child, and I grow those tiny Alpine strawberries
that the French call the ‘Four Seasons.’ On that fatal Saturday
last May, hearing that poor Emily Garlett was feeling
rather less well than usual, I took her up my first gathering,
so to speak. Though the berries were rather white they
were very sweet. To think that they should have helped to
kill her!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And was it your sugar, too?” asked the rector abruptly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good gracious, no—of course not! I took the strawberries
to the Thatched House in a little covered basket
which I left with Miss Cheale, and she brought me back the
basket that same evening.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did Mr. Garlett allude to the strawberries in his speech
to-day?” inquired Mrs. Cole-Wright.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry to say he did. He denied absolutely that he
had given his wife any strawberries. He said that he had
never even seen them! But of course no one doubted that
Maclean had told the truth, the more so that one could see
that he gave his damning evidence with the greatest reluctance.
I thought at one moment that the poor fellow was going
to break down. It’s an awful thing for the Macleans.
I feel truly sorry for them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mean because of Jean Bower?” observed his wife.
Then she gave a curious little laugh. “Men are so sentimental,
aren’t they, Miss Prince? The girl will get over it
soon enough, Philip—never you fear! It’s lucky they
weren’t already married. There I admit that Jean Bower
and the Macleans have had a lucky escape. But as for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>girl, no pity need be wasted over her. Why, she hardly
knew Harry Garlett, when he came back four months ago!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope that’s true,” remarked Miss Prince in a singular
tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What d’you mean?” asked her hostess eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have my doubts as to the terms they were on before
Harry went away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you mean before his wife died?” asked the rector,
in a horror-struck tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear Philip,” exclaimed his wife. “Do you <i>never</i>
hear any gossip?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never heard any gossip as to the relations of these two
people,” he said decidedly. Then, looking at his wife, “Did
you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t remember exactly when I first heard a word said.
But I do remember that I didn’t believe a word of it,” answered
Mrs. Cole-Wright. “But of course I’ll change my
mind if Miss Prince has any evidence that they were intimate——?”
and she looked fixedly at her visitor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Intimate!” exclaimed the rector in a horrified tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All I can say is,” Miss Prince spoke in a dogged tone,
“that on the very morning I took those strawberries to the
Thatched House, Harry Garlett and Miss Bower walked
back together from Grendon across the fields. I saw them
with my own eyes, just before I left the house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As the husband and wife leaned forward in their chairs
and looked at her full of keen, if rather shamefaced, curiosity,
she went on composedly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d already heard some talk about them even then. Jean
Bower’s a very attractive girl, for all her quiet ways. Old
Dodson was crazy about her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Cole-Wright said musingly: “When one comes to
think of it, Jean Bower was at the Etna China factory some
time before Mrs. Garlett’s death. She first came here in the
winter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So she did—I’d forgotten that! Still, if Mrs. Maclean
is to be believed,” observed the rector, “she and her husband
were utterly taken by surprise over the engagement. The
day she came to see me about the marriage—you remember
how quiet they wanted it to be—she admitted that they had
both thought the girl liked Tasker.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“Dr. Tasker has reason to be thankful to-day,” said Miss
Prince slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why?” asked husband and wife.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because,” she replied briskly, “could anything be more
awful than to have one’s bride, even one’s fiancée, mixed
up in such an affair?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“D’you really think Jean Bower would have been mixed
up in it—if she’d been engaged to Tasker?” asked the rector
in a pained tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One never can tell,” said Miss Prince sententiously, forgetting—as
scandal-mongers are apt to forget—that in this
life one cannot have it both ways.</p>

<p class='c008'>She went on eagerly, “However, Dr. Tasker is out of it,
and, next to Harry Garlett himself, the one most affected
is Dr. Maclean. Mark my words—there’ll be an awful falling-off
in his practice!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She did not utter that prediction with any touch of regret
in her voice, for she had never liked her father’s successor.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a pause she added, “He showed himself grossly
careless, if not worse, when signing poor Emily’s death
certificate.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He was certainly taken in,” said Mrs. Cole-Wright
acidly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rector exclaimed: “Yes, indeed! By the way, he
made great play to-day with the fact that he was being called
as a common, and not as an expert, or skilled, witness.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How very odd,” observed Mrs. Cole-Wright. “Surely
a doctor is always an expert—or ought to be?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, no, not according to law,” said the rector. “According
to him—and I could see that none of the magistrates
dared to contradict him—he was only bound to state, as any
other witness might have done, the facts that had fallen
under his own observation. They tried hard to make him
say what he thought himself as to Garlett’s guilt or innocence,
but he refused, very properly, to give an opinion.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course it will be got out of him at the trial,” exclaimed
his wife.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you know whether Dr. Maclean is to appear for the
prosecution or the defence?” asked Miss Prince.</p>

<p class='c008'>“For the prosecution, surely?” cried Mrs. Cole-Wright
quickly. “But the defence will cross-examine him, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>pity the poor man if, as I heard yesterday, Sir Harold
Anstey has already been briefed by Mr. Toogood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maclean said one thing that struck me very much,” said
the rector. “He reminded the magistrates that a medical
witness should always remember that he is not retained for
any particular person, but in the cause of justice alone. I
think you will find that he will make a most excellent witness.
He certainly managed to conceal what he really thought from
me—I could form no opinion as to whether he believes Garlett
innocent or guilty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’d have made it out fast enough if he thought the
man innocent,” said his wife shrewdly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course he knows Harry Garlett to be guilty,” exclaimed
Miss Prince in a hard voice. “I don’t see how any
one can doubt it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How well I remember,” went on the rector, “Dr. Maclean
coming up that Sunday morning, just as I was going into
church, to tell me of Mrs. Garlett’s death. He looked terribly
tired, for he had been up most of the night. But still we had
a little talk about it. I was very much shocked, for, if you
remember”—he turned to his wife—“I had seen Mrs. Garlett
the day before, and she had seemed to me rather brighter
than usual.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He waited a moment, then exclaimed: “By the way, I
remember now that Maclean actually mentioned those strawberries
as having caused the acute indigestion which resulted
in her death!”</p>

<p class='c008'>His wife looked at him apprehensively. “Be careful
what you say, Philip. You don’t want to be called as a
witness?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I don’t. Miss Prince? May I rely upon you
not to tell any one of this curious little piece of corroborative
evidence?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What the rector said is not evidence,” said Mrs. Cole-Wright
lightly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her husband looked at her puzzled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One can never be quite sure as to who may be called
upon to give evidence,” observed Miss Prince. “But the one
witness they are sure to call at the trial is Jean Bower.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What an awful ordeal it will be for the poor girl,” said
Mr. Cole-Wright in a moved tone.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“The person I shall feel sorry for,” broke in his wife, “is
Miss Cheale. I respect that young woman. She was always
so quiet, so dignified, and kept herself to herself. She will
be a most important witness.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And she seems to have been the only person actually
with Mrs. Garlett when the poor soul passed away,” chimed
in the rector.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was surprised at the time,” observed Mrs. Cole-Wright,
“that there was neither an inquest nor a post-mortem with a
person so important in her own way as poor Mrs. Garlett.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And there’s another thing,” said the rector hesitatingly,
“though perhaps I hardly ought to tell it to you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course you must tell us, Philip. All we are saying
here is absolutely private——”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked at Miss Prince, and Miss Prince nodded,
gravely:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Harry Garlett was exceedingly anxious that the burial
should take place two days earlier than it did,” said the
clergyman impressively. “This fact, to which I now attach a
sinister significance, was the more ominous because, instead
of raising the question himself, he got Miss Cheale to do so.
Miss Cheale and that queer, sickly brother of hers came and
asked me if the funeral could take place on the Thursday
instead of on the Saturday. Miss Cheale said that Garlett
was anxious to have the funeral as soon as possible. But
that again”—he turned to Miss Prince—“is a thing I
naturally do not wish made public. The wretched man will
be condemned on direct, not circumstantial, evidence, unless
I’m much mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose he will,” said Miss Prince.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she got up to go. She had enjoyed every moment of
her visit, save during the short discussion as to the forced
Alpine strawberries.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Lucy Warren was moving about her little kitchen trying
to make work for herself. She was miserable with the dull
dogged misery bred of hope deferred. Since the night she
had seen Guy Cheale disappear through the drawing room
window of the Thatched House, she had only had one short
interchange of words with him.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Months had gone by since then, and yet to Lucy Warren
the wounds inflicted on her pride as well as on her heart were
still open wounds. She was of course excited and interested
in the question of Mrs. Garlett’s death, but to her the one
thing that mattered was the mystery of Guy Cheale’s disappearance
out of her life.</p>

<p class='c008'>This afternoon the man she had come to love was very
present to her mind. She seemed to see his keen, mocking
face rise up before her. It was as if his heavy-lidded gray
eyes—eyes that could be at once so cruel and so tender, were
following her about.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her feelings toward Agatha Cheale had undergone no
change—in fact, when that young lady had stayed at the
Thatched Cottage—Lucy had quietly told Miss Prince that
she would not meet her, and Miss Prince had allowed Lucy’s
sister to take her place for the time. Often since then, poor
Lucy had regretted that she had not forced herself to stay
and face her enemy. She would, maybe, have learned something
as to Guy Cheale and his condition; she might even
have had the good fortune to discover his address.</p>

<p class='c008'>As these thoughts were drifting through her mind, there
came at the back door a curious, furtive, uncertain knock.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a strange sense of foreboding at her heart, she went
and unlatched the door, and for a moment she thought the
slight woman whose face was swathed in a long motor veil a
stranger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to see Miss Prince,” said the husky voice Lucy
remembered only too well. Then came a surprise: “Why,
it’s Lucy Warren! Tell me—do you know if Mr. Garlett
was committed for trial this morning?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lucy stared at the unexpected visitor, remembering that
Miss Cheale was supposed to be too ill to leave London.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know what’s happened to Mr. Garlett. I’m expecting
Miss Prince back every minute. She’ll have found
out for sure,” said Lucy coldly. “Come in, do! You look
perished with cold, miss.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Agatha Cheale came through into the warm kitchen. She
loosened her concealing veil, and Lucy saw that her face was
thin and worn. She looked very ill, and though there seemed
nothing in common between her and her big, fair brother,
yet to-day Lucy did see a kind of family resemblance which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>made her heart beat faster, and impelled her to do a thing
she would have thought herself incapable of doing even for
Miss Prince. It was in a tone of kindly sympathy that she
exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sit you down, miss, and I’ll take off your boots and bring
a pair of shoes for you to put on!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Agatha Cheale sat down wearily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll take off my boots myself,” she said, “but I shall be
glad of the shoes, though I can’t stay long.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mother’s fretted a deal about Mr. Cheale,” said Lucy
nervously. “Is he quite well?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A challenging look flashed between the two young women,
and then Agatha Cheale said coldly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have no idea where my brother is. The last time I
saw him was about a month after he left here. He was then
going abroad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Almost as if the words were dragged out of her, Miss
Cheale added: “He asked me about the Thatched Farm—how
you all were, and so on. But I told him I did not know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>After Lucy had fetched Miss Prince’s warm bedroom
slippers, she asked the visitor: “Won’t you come into the
little sitting room? I’ve kept up a good fire there. Miss
Prince will be back in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But it seemed a very long time both to the young lady
sitting in the parlour and to the maid sitting in the kitchen,
before there came the familiar knock at the front door.
Miss Prince would have thought it quite wrong, almost a
“fast” thing to do, to let herself in with a latchkey.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Lucy opened the door she whispered: “Miss Cheale is
here, waiting to see you, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Cheale!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince could hardly believe her ears. She had supposed
her friend to be ill in bed, in London.</p>

<p class='c008'>As she came in to her sitting room, Agatha Cheale stood
up, a look of agonized suspense on her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is Harry Garlett committed for trial?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course he is—surely you did not expect anything
else?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Miss Prince felt suddenly disturbed and angry.
She disliked intensely anything that savoured of hysterical
emotion, and here was Agatha Cheale clasping her hands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>together with a wild gesture, and exclaiming: “How terrible!
For he is innocent—innocent!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You cannot possibly know whether he is innocent or
guilty,” said Miss Prince coldly. “Sit down, my dear.
We’ll have tea in a moment.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He <i>is</i> innocent,” cried the other passionately. “I know
Harry Garlett far, far better than I have ever admitted—even
to you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince’s heart seemed to leap in her breast. Was
she at last to be positively assured of something which no one
but herself had ever suspected, with the one exception,
maybe, of Dr. Maclean?</p>

<p class='c008'>Agatha Cheale sat staring before her, a look of terrible
suffering in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The older woman at last ventured: “You mean, my dear,
that there were love passages between you? I always suspected
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No!” almost screamed Agatha Cheale, starting up from
her chair. “There were no love passages between us. What
love there was was on my side—my side alone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then she broke into bitter sobs. “I’m a wicked
woman, a wicked woman——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nonsense, my dear! If there have been no love passages,
you are not a wicked woman,” said practical Miss Prince.</p>

<p class='c008'>She walked over to where her friend still stood, a dreadful
look of rigid misery on her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sit down,” she said quietly, taking up the other’s hot,
nerveless hand. “Sit down, Agatha. You’re in a high fever,
I do believe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have been in bed on and off for nearly ten days. But
I felt I must come down here and learn what had really
happened to-day. Have you seen any one who was there?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I’ve seen the rector. What told against Harry most
was Dr. Maclean’s evidence. But no arsenic has yet been
traced to his possession.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In spite of herself, as she said those last words Miss
Prince’s voice altered slightly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why should he be suspected then—more than any one
else who was in the house at the time?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince thought this a very silly question.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is absolutely certain, Agatha, is that poor Emily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>died, poisoned with an unusually large quantity of
arsenic.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know that,” said Miss Cheale in a quieter tone. “And
yet—I daresay you will think me very foolish—though I do
know it’s true, somehow I can’t believe it. Once or twice
I’ve wondered—you’ll think me raving mad”—her voice
sank almost to a whisper as she fixed her burning, sunken
eyes on Miss Prince’s face—“if the analyst, the man who
made the examination, could have mixed up poor Mrs. Garlett’s
remains with those of some one else?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear Agatha!” the older woman looked at her with
concern, and then, choosing her words, she said: “You
mustn’t allow your feelings of affection for Mr. Garlett
to affect——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know what you mean,” broke in Agatha Cheale. “But
while my reason tells me Emily Garlett was poisoned, everything
else tells me that it can’t be true.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve often wondered,” said Miss Prince suddenly, “what
first started the inquiry. After all, none of us had the
slightest suspicion there was anything wrong, had we?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Agatha Cheale turned herself about, and sitting down,
gazed into the fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” she said at last, in a voice that had now become
collected and steady, “though none of us suspected anything
at the time, there may have been some outsider who thought
it odd that there was no inquest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can tell you who that outsider was,” exclaimed Miss
Prince. “Mrs. Cole-Wright thought it a most extraordinary
thing that there was no inquest! I remember her saying so
to me the very day of the funeral.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps she wrote to the police,” said Agatha Cheale in
a hesitating voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sure she didn’t. She’s a cautious woman, and she’s
always liked Harry Garlett. No! it’s far more likely that
some one who saw Harry carrying on with Jean Bower in the
factory wrote to the police.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose they called the girl as a witness?” said Agatha
Cheale. There was acrid bitterness in her voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” said Miss Prince, “they didn’t call her, oddly
enough. They seem to have decided to do without her. Dr.
Maclean was most anxious she shouldn’t be called. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>said she was ill, and, after all, he’s the medical attendant of
every one of the magistrates who were there——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Does she still consider herself engaged to Mr. Garlett?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She certainly does. Though, as to that, I can tell you a
very curious thing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Agatha Cheale turned round eagerly, her face full of intense,
painful curiosity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Harry Garlett has absolutely refused to see Jean Bower—I
mean since his arrest. Some people say it’s nearly broken
her heart. She’s so pale and thin you’d hardly believe her to
be the pretty girl of a few weeks ago.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The other drew a long breath. “So he won’t see her?
Then he can’t have really cared for her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She waited a moment, and then added in an odd tone,
“He is a very cold man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince was surprised, “I shouldn’t call him that——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Agatha Cheale turned round and looked straight into
the older woman’s face. “He is what foreigners call ‘A
Jaseph,’” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince shrank back, almost as if she had been struck.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear Agatha—what a horrid expression!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a true expression,” answered Agatha Cheale. “We’ll
never speak of this again, and I don’t want you to have a
worse impression of me than you must. But I cared for
Harry Garlett, and I did my utmost—my utmost—to make
him care for me. I failed. Let’s leave it at that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did Emily suspect that you liked him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good God, no!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And again Miss Prince shrank back a little. This was an
Agatha Cheale she did not know—a violent, unrestrained
human being, laying her soul bare as few human beings ever
have the cruel courage to do.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope you got poor Emily’s legacy all right?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I got it almost at once. It enabled me to send my
brother abroad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How is he?” asked Miss Prince.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know, he never writes to me, unless he wants
money,” she said bitterly. “I’ve only cared for two people
in my life—my brother and Harry Garlett—and neither of
them have cared for me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She got up. “I must be going back! The driver of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>car I hired at Dill Junction had a friend in Grendon. I said
he could go there for an hour. I was afraid he might go
into the village, and cause gossip. I think I heard the car
come up just now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder if I ought to let you go away?” said Miss
Prince hesitatingly. “You don’t look fit to go back to London
to-day, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I couldn’t stay here. If I did I should get into serious
trouble for not having appeared at the Police Court to-day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned and put her arms around Miss Prince’s angular
neck. “Good-bye, Mary. You’re a good friend,” she exclaimed.
“Forget all I’ve said to-day!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will,” said Miss Prince soberly, “indeed I will, Agatha.
I don’t feel as if you are really yourself, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not myself in a sense, and yet in another sense I’m
quite myself, more myself than you’ve ever seen me be.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The great tide of life flows on steadily, ruthlessly, whatever
be the tragedies or comedies being enacted below the swift-moving
waters. Dr. Maclean had an important consultation
early that afternoon with a great London specialist. And
though both his wife and his niece were aware that he could
not be in to lunch, yet both of them shrank from learning the
news as to whether Harry Garlett was a free man or had
been committed for trial from any one but him.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the clock had struck two, Jean constantly took the
little gold watch, which she wore on an old-fashioned gold
chain round her neck, out of her belt, and Mrs. Maclean felt
that they had both come near the breaking point.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s put on our things and walk to meet your uncle,”
she said at last. “You won’t mind our seeing people on the
road who may stop and speak to us?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t mind anything,” she answered listlessly, and soon
they were walking quickly in the direction from where they
knew Dr. Maclean was to come. As they hurried through
the biting January wind a little colour came into Jean’s face
and she began to look more herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s foolish to feel as I do to-day,” she said at last. “I’m
not really in suspense, for of course I know quite well that
Harry has been committed for trial. Nothing excepting a
miracle happening—I mean the guilty person coming forward—could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>have prevented it. And yet?—and yet, Aunt Jenny,
I hope against hope!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So do I,” said Mrs. Maclean in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last they saw the familiar little car rolling along very
much more quickly than it was apt to do, and as the doctor
drove up to them a glance at his face was enough.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course he’s committed for trial. Nothing new came
out—one way or the other.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then in a voice which he tried to make colourless, he went
on: “I’ve got a letter for you from Harry, child. I was to
give it to you only if he was committed for trial. Would
you like us two to drive on, leaving you to read it and walk
home alone?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked up into his kind, tired face—oh, so gratefully,
and held out her hand for the envelope.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think I’ll go walking on, for a bit, by myself. Don’t be
frightened if I don’t come in for an hour or so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She tried to smile, but failed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Maclean got into the car, and the husband and wife
drove off together, their hearts heavy with pity and that
most painful of sensations that nothing they could say or do
could help the poor girl they both loved so dearly.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a few moments Mrs. Maclean made a restless movement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t look round,” said the doctor sharply. “I know
what’s in the letter I’ve just given the poor lass. He’s not
only offered to release her from their engagement, but he
begs her strongly to allow it to come to an end. Whatever
he may have done, there’s something very fine about the chap.
Both Toogood and the governor of the prison told me that
Jean is never out of his mind—and not selfishly in it, mark
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’ll never give him up,” said Mrs. Maclean woefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bide a wee, my dear. I think she’ll do anything he asks
her to do; and though I haven’t seen the letter I know that
he’s put it very strongly to her. He’s assured her—a splendid
lie if ever there was one—that the breaking of their engagement
will be to his benefit, I mean during the course of the
trial.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If he’s said that, perhaps she’ll do it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The governor had a little talk with me before the proceedings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>began. He’s so much impressed with Garlett’s way
of taking the whole thing that he half believes him to be
innocent. I wish I could believe it”—unconsciously he was
slowing down—“it’s no good my pretending that I don’t
feel very wretched, the more so that I know well enough that
if he’s hung it will be my testimony that will hang him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Were you asked anything about Jean?” asked his wife in
a low voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I was! And of course I had to admit that
she’d been at the factory fully five weeks before Emily Garlett’s
death. Also that they’d corresponded while he was
away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jock! You never said that? Why, it was only the most
formal business correspondence,” exclaimed Mrs. Maclean
dismayed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They particularly questioned me about it, and though I
tried to make the truth as clear as I could, I don’t think they
believed me. Then I had to admit that the moment he came
back he and she were always together. Garlett’s head foreman
was called. I felt sorry for the poor chap—he is obviously
attached to Jean, but he had to confess that the
factory was humming with talk about them long before they
became engaged. That stupid, daft old Sir William Harding
asked: ‘You mean before Mrs. Garlett’s death?’ and the
foreman was so bewildered that he actually answered: ‘I
don’t seem to remember exactly when the talk about them
did begin.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And will it all be put in the papers?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course it will.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Jean walked on, Harry Garlett’s letter, still unopened, in
her hand, till she came to a little wood which she knew
would be almost certainly deserted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once in the now leafless wilderness, she began walking
slowly, her feet sinking into the sodden, fallen leaves, longing
and yet dreading to know what Harry had written to
her.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last she slowly opened the square, official-looking
envelope. Written across the top were the words: “Read
and passed by J.C. Brackbury, Governor of H.M. Prison,
Grendon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was used to that sentence, but somehow to-day the pain
and shame that such a letter as she supposed she was going
to read, an intimate love-letter, should have been seen by any
other eyes than her own, brought a new anguish.</p>

<p class='c008'>She unfolded the big, plain sheet of notepaper, and at
once she saw that there was no beginning or end to the
letter. The fact that this was so gave her a quick, frightened
feeling of foreboding.</p>

<p class='c010'>If, as Toogood is obviously convinced will be the case, I am committed
for trial, then, Jean, I want you to do something for me.</p>

<p class='c010'>You’ve never failed me, and I trust you to see this thing as I
see it myself. I want you, my dear, to release me. By that I mean
that it is my wish our engagement should be at an end. I know you
believe I’m an innocent man; but I’ve gone through hell since I was
arrested, knowing that all unwittingly I have brought not only
grief, but unutterable shame, on you and on those kind, good friends
of mine, Dr. and Mrs. Maclean. I am told that nothing done now
can prevent your being called as a witness at my trial, but I’m convinced
that if you appear as a simple witness, and not as a woman
engaged to me, it will be infinitely better not only for you, but for
me also. This is why I ask you most solemnly to allow our engagement
to come to an end, and to let the fact be widely advertised.
As Toogood has reminded me more than once, we were, after all,
only engaged for a very short time. But may I say, Jean, in this,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>my last, letter to you, for I do not intend to write again, and I beg
you will not do so, that not only during the last few weeks but ever
since I came home, you have made me as happy as any woman ever
made any man, though in saying so I’m showing myself to be what
every man is—selfish. Yet I like to believe that you will be glad
to know that the happy days we spent together before I knew I
loved you, the happy days we have shared since we knew we loved
one another, have made up, to me at least, for everything that has
come to pass. The thankfulness and wonder that one so unworthy
as myself should have been blessed with your love will remain with
me to the very end, and, I firmly believe, beyond.</p>

<p class='c010'>I know you well enough to feel quite sure that you will not be
hurt, still less surprised, to receive none of those last words and
messages which only satisfy the morbid, horrible curiosity of a
callous, cruel world. And so good-bye, my own, my only, love.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean Bower put the letter back in its envelope and thrust
it in her bosom. She walked through the wood on to the
now deserted stretch of downland that had been turned
into a golf course by the enterprising municipality of Grendon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beyond the course there were a few pretty houses which
now, in the deepening twilight, were being lighted up, and
all at once Jean, in the midst of her agonized and bewildered
questionings, remembered that in one of these houses lived
Mr. and Mrs. Toogood and their only daughter. She remembered
having gone there last August with her aunt to call on
Mrs. Toogood.</p>

<p class='c008'>She quickened her steps, and striking across the links, soon
reached Mr. Toogood’s house.</p>

<p class='c008'>In answer to her ring, a maid opened the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is Mr. Toogood back yet from his office? Could I see
him?” asked Jean. “I won’t keep him five minutes, but it’s
very urgent!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The master never sees any one on business out of office
hours.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, suddenly, the young woman realized who the visitor
was, and a thrill of joyful excitement ran through her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, it’s Miss Bower, isn’t it? I’m sure Mr. Toogood
will see <i>you</i>, miss.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She led the way to a comfortable-looking library. A big
fire was burning, and gratefully Jean sank into an easy chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>Burning with curiosity and excitement, the girl hurried off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>to the dining room, where her master, while enjoying his tea,
had been telling his wife and daughter every detail of Harry
Garlett’s appearance before the magistrates and his committal
for trial.</p>

<p class='c008'>The maid was not lacking in a certain dramatic instinct,
so when she came into the dining room she shut the door and
said demurely:</p>

<p class='c008'>“A young lady to see you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Toogood looked up sharply. “No one on business, I
hope?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s Miss Jean Bower,” announced the girl in a hissing
whisper. “She do look miserable! I thought you’d see <i>her</i>,
sir. She only wants to see you for five minutes, and says
it’s very urgent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jean Bower!” exclaimed Mrs. Toogood. “And all by
herself? You’re sure the doctor’s not with her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I’m sure, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Miss Toogood broke in: “I wonder what she’s
come to say! I wonder whether <i>she</i> poisoned Mrs. Garlett,
and whether she’s come to confess it to Father? Jimmy
Danetree says that they ought to have called her as a witness
this morning——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I forbid you to discuss Harry Garlett’s affair with young
men,” interposed her father sharply.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was on his way to the door, and though he too felt
excited, he thought he knew what Jean Bower had come to
tell him. Indeed he was sure that she had come to say that
her engagement was at an end, and to ask him to make that
fact known as widely as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>He walked into his study and held out his hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Miss Bower? I’m glad that you’ve come here to-night,
instead of to my office to-morrow morning. Now
that’s the very first time I’ve ever said that to any client of
mine—and I feel quite sure I shall never say it again! Sit
down, my dear young lady; I think I know the business that
has brought you,” and his voice became very kindly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think you can know why I have come,” she said
in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think I do, for I had a talk with Mr. Garlett just before
we went into the police court this morning. He told me
he’d written you a letter which he was going to ask your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>uncle to deliver in case he was committed for trial. He did
not show me the letter, but he told me what was in it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve come to ask you a very important question,” said
Jean in a firm tone. She fixed her eyes on the shrewd face
of the man standing before her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I ask you—and I want you to answer as if you were on
oath, Mr. Toogood—will it do Harry good, or will it do him
harm, if I break my engagement now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The lawyer felt annoyed, as well as very much taken aback.
For one thing, he could not tell by her manner whether she
wished his answer to be “yes” or “no.” So he answered her
evasively:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know that Mr. Garlett strongly wishes the engagement
to be broken off, Miss Bower. He spoke very frankly to me
this morning, and he said he hoped with all his heart that
you would do as he wished.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I realize all that,” she answered, with what was for her
a curious and most unusual touch of irritation in her voice.
“But I am not thinking of what he wishes me to do. What
I want you to tell me is what will be best for him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then suddenly she saw into Mr. Toogood’s mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Surely,” she exclaimed, “you don’t think that I wish to
break our engagement?”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a pitiful little smile she added slowly: “To do that
would break my heart, but I will, if you tell me that’s it’s
honestly the best thing for Harry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was so touched, so surprised at her words, that he felt
he would like to take her in his arms and hug her.</p>

<p class='c008'>What a splendid girl she was, and that even if she had
allowed her employer, the husband of poor ailing Emily
Garlett, to make love to her in his wife’s lifetime! She
deserved to know the truth—the real truth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“About that,” he said decidedly, “I can set your mind
at rest. Though I should not like to be quoted as having
said it, I haven’t a doubt that, in as far as public opinion
plays any part in a great law case, the fact that you have
remained faithful to Mr. Garlett can do him nothing but
good.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean sighed convulsively, and tears of relief began running
down her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We take our stand on Garlett’s absolute innocence,” continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>the lawyer. “We wish to prove that he hardly realized
your existence till some months after his wife’s death. That
is the point on which you will have to try and convince judge,
jury, and the very clever gentleman who will lead the
Prosecution for the Crown. Now it is obvious to me that
if you set out to do that as the woman who loves the prisoner
in the dock, and absolutely believes in his innocence, that
fact will give your words far more weight than if you come
into court admitting that you have broken off your engagement.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then why,” she whispered, “did he write me this letter?
In spite of the loving things he said in it toward the end, I
felt a sort of dreadful doubt, as if he no longer cared for me——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No longer cared for you?” exclaimed Mr. Toogood, wiping
his spectacles. “Why, my dear young lady, it’s entirely
for <i>your</i> sake that he wrote that letter. Didn’t you understand
that? He won’t be allowed to see any of the newspapers
after to-day, but up to to-day the Governor stretched
a point. But it was no kindness, for some of the things the
papers printed made him feel simply frantic. He was
awfully upset at some article which said that you thought his
wife had committed suicide. He wanted to have it contradicted!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never saw any statement of that sort,” said Jean
astonished. “I can hardly believe they can have dared to
say such a thing. Of course I feel sure that Mrs. Garlett
did not commit suicide.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I wouldn’t go so far as to say that. Quite frequently
it happens that a man takes his own life when every
one round him would have sworn him utterly incapable of
doing such a thing. If that is often true of a man, it is
truer of a woman, for your sex is far more sensitive than
mine, Miss Bower.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“May I write an answer to Harry here?” said Jean.</p>

<p class='c008'>He put a sheet of paper before her on his writing table,
and taking up a pencil she wrote quickly:</p>

<p class='c010'>I cannot do what you wish. I would have done so if not doing
it would have done you harm. But I have found, thank God, that
to break our engagement would do you harm rather than good.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“And now,” observed Mr. Toogood, “I’ll just put my
boots on again, and see you home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed, you’ll do nothing of the kind!” exclaimed Jean,
and this time she really smiled. “I’m not a bit afraid. Besides,
it isn’t really dark.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She took his hand and squeezed it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ve never made anybody happier than you’ve made
me to-day,” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Jean Bower slipped quietly back into Bonnie Doon,
she amazed them all—those three kind folk who felt so unhappy
and anxious about her, her uncle, her aunt, and Elsie—by
being bright, cheerful, and full of courage and hope.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a few minutes she went up to her bedroom. The
writing table there was one of the few things she had brought
from her old home. She went over it, and taking up an
envelope, slipped Harry Garlett’s letter inside it. Then she
wrote outside: “In case of my death I wish this envelope
to be put in my coffin, over my heart”—and then she placed
it in a drawer where she knew it would be found at once,
should she die while still an inmate of the house where she
had known such intense joy and such bitter sorrow.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>After the first burst of excitement following the day of
Harry Garlett’s appearance before the magistrates and his
being committed for trial, all mention of the Terriford
Mystery dropped gradually out of the newspapers; for
weeks, sometimes even months, elapse between the committal
of a man charged with murder and the actual opening
of the legal drama which is to decide whether he is to enjoy
life and freedom, or suffer a hideous and shameful death.</p>

<p class='c008'>But though from the point of view of the public the case
temporarily disappeared, there were still innumerable men
and women all over England who seemed to find it impossible
to banish the story from their minds. Many of the people
with whom Jean had drifted into acquaintance during her
life, and especially during the course of her war work, wrote
to her with either strong interest or sympathy. But she
received other letters of a very different character, and
terrible letters some of them were, so venomous and cruel in
their wording that they seemed as if inspired by personal
hatred. A typical example ran as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span><span class='sc'>Wicked Woman</span>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>My husband’s love has been taken away from me by his typist,
so I know exactly what poor Mrs. Garlett must have felt during that
time when you were insidiously worming your way into the heart of
your employer. Your conduct was the more horrible because, as is
the case with my husband, that brute, Garlett, owed everything to
his wife. I am eagerly looking forward to the day when you will
stand in the witness box and all your sins be brought to light, also to
the day when he will be hung.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Your evil wisher,</div>
      <div class='line in16'><span class='sc'>A Deserted Wife</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Of the letters written to her by people known to her there
was only one that seemed to bring a touch of comfort to her
sore heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>It came from a girl, Rachel North by name, with whom
she had worked for eight months in a war hospital. They
had drifted into something very like close friendship during
that time, but, as so often happens in life, though they had
each made an effort to keep up their friendship by correspondence,
the letters had become fewer and fewer on either
side, and had now ceased for nearly a year. Thus Jean was
the more touched when she received the following letter
from her friend:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>January 14th.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>My dear Jean</span>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This is only to tell you that I feel deeply grieved for you and
that you are a great deal in my thoughts. I know so well what you
must be going through, and I will tell you now what I have never
told you yet. My father, to whom I was devoted, was falsely accused
of having embezzled a considerable sum of money. Though
he was only technically guilty, for it was his partner who had embezzled
the money, it was thought that my father had shown carelessness.
Accordingly, though the other man got four years, my
father received six months’ imprisonment. His death occurred two
months after he had left prison.</p>

<p class='c010'>I hope, my dear, that this man whom you love and who seems to
be a splendid fellow, will get through his awful ordeal. Don’t
trouble to answer this letter, but remember that if at any time you
want to spend a night in London I can take you in. I am now cashier
in a big boot store. The work is hard and the pay is poor, but I
have had the great luck to be lent a small flat of three rooms for
six months.</p>

<p class='c010'>Your old friend who never forgets what a difference you made
to her life during that dreary time in that convalescent hospital,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Rachel North</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>This was the only letter that Jean had cared to keep, and
after answering it she had put it carefully away. It had
comforted her, if only because it had been written by some
one who had gone through in a smaller measure the anxiety,
the anguish, and the suspense she was going through
now.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though the world at large had suspended its interest in
the Terriford Mystery, that was not the case in this neighbourhood.
There the excitement was kept alive by all sorts
of happenings. The chief of these was the occasional appearance
of James Kentworthy, and his eager attempts to
get hold of any shred of evidence that would help his client.
But in spite of his efforts he found no one who could throw
even a glimmer of light on the apparently unsolvable problem
of Emily Garlett’s death. The one weak link in the
evidence against Harry Garlett, from the point of view of
the prosecution, continued to be that up to the present no
arsenic had been traced in any form to his possession. Inquiries
were still being made all over England, and especially
where Garlett had been either playing cricket or acting as a
glorified commercial traveller to the Etna China factory.
But so far these inquiries had yielded nothing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Kentworthy had built great hopes on an interview
with Agatha Cheale; but though on two occasions he had
managed to force himself into her presence, she had, while
coldly civil, replied to his questions: “I have been subpœnaed
by the prosecution, and I understand that it would
be quite out of order to give you any information. Besides,
I could only tell you exactly what I told them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With Miss Prince he had again become on surprisingly
friendly terms. They often discussed the case, and to him
she always professed she kept an open mind. Yet Mr. Kentworthy
felt sure that she knew something not to Harry
Garlett’s credit. Once or twice he had thought her on the
point of confiding to him what this was. But at the last moment
she always quickly drew back, and made up her mind
to be silent.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if on friendly terms with Miss Prince, the inquiry
agent was not on friendly terms with Lucy Warren. Again
and again he tried to make the girl amplify her former statement
to him. But all she would say now was: “I’m very sorry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>I said anything to you about it! Maybe it was not Mr.
Garlett at all that was in the wood. It’s easy enough to
make a mistake at night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked unhappy, scornful, and embittered with life,
and one day he casually received a hint as to why that was
so, from the village postmistress:</p>

<p class='c008'>“There be some as says Miss Cheale’s brother, the gentleman
who was Mrs. Warren’s lodger at the Thatched Farm,
made up to Lucy. If that’s so, he’s gone and left her high
and dry! Mind you, I don’t say that it’s true, but there be
some as says so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He decided that there must be something in it. The girl
looked as if she had been crossed in love.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last it seemed as if Mr. Kentworthy had left the village
for good. He had done everything that could be done there
in the way of inquiry and suggestion, and he made up his
mind to investigate the whole case from the angle of Harry
Garlett’s life as a popular cricketer, welcome in many a great
country house, and indeed everywhere where the national
game has its experts and devotees.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he had been gone only some ten days when there arrived
for Jean Bower the following letter:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Dear Miss Bower</span>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>I promised to let you know when Sir Harold Anstey would be
back in town. I learn that he arrived home from the south of
France yesterday. He is going away somewhere for the week-end,
but he will be in his chambers in King’s Bench Walk from Tuesday
onward.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have no doubt that among your uncle’s more important patients
there must be someone acquainted with Sir Harold who would be
willing to give you a note of introduction to him. It might, however,
be better to call on him and just take your chance.</p>

<p class='c010'>I wish I had some good news for you. I am going on prosecuting
my inquiries in a somewhat new field. In such a case as this, one
never knows when one may obtain a clue.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yours very truly,</div>
      <div class='line in4'><span class='sc'>James Kentworthy</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>P. S. What you have to do with regard to Sir Harold Anstey
is to convince him, as fully as you have convinced me, of the truth
of your and Mr. Garlett’s assertion that you were scarcely acquainted
at the time of his wife’s death, and that you did not become really
friends till close on five months later. Do not forget to take with
you the facsimiles of—you know what.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Jean made up her mind at once that she would act on
Kentworthy’s second thoughts. She decided, therefore, to
go by herself to London, and, without giving him any notice,
call at the famous barrister’s chambers on the chance of
seeing him.</p>

<p class='c008'>So the two people, whose anxious loving scrutiny of her
day by day was sometimes more than she could bear, were
disturbed and surprised when she suddenly observed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to go to London next Monday by myself. I’ve
got a friend who will put me up for the night. I don’t want
to tell you why I’m going, so please don’t ask me. But
you will be glad to know that it is something I’m doing
with the full approval of Mr. Kentworthy.” And then suddenly
she grew very red. “I ought not to have said that,”
she exclaimed in a distressed tone. “Will you try and forget
it, and never, never tell any one?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked from one to the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well, my dear. But be careful. Mr. Toogood told
me the other day that he had a great horror of anything like
amateur”—the doctor hesitated a moment and then said,
“spying.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not going to spy,” said Jean, and she looked hurt.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, well, my dear, forgive me for saying that! But
you know what I mean? I don’t want you mixed up with
any of Kentworthy’s dirty, if necessary, work——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not if it helped Harry, Uncle Jock?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not even if it helped Garlett, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned away, and he knew that she would stick at
nothing that would help the man she loved.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Sir Harold Anstey came bustling into his pleasant
chambers. He had only just come back from a long
week-end, there was a bright fire burning in the attractive,
wasteful, eighteenth-century grate, and the famous Old
Bailey barrister felt not only fresh and keen, but on the
happiest terms with himself and the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great advocate was a big, florid, good-looking man,
and so popular a bachelor that it was no wonder he had never
made up his mind to become true to one lady.</p>

<p class='c008'>Like most successful men, he attached great importance
to the Press of his country, and he paid considerable court
to those newspaper men with whom he came in contact. So
of the pile of letters, opened and unopened, on his writing-table,
Sir Harold first turned to a bulky envelope from his
press-cutting agency.</p>

<p class='c008'>The envelope contained a page cut from a popular picture
paper, and across the top of the sheet ran: “The Terriford
Mystery: Exclusive Photographs.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Harold smiled when he saw that the pictures were
grouped round his own comely, bewigged visage. He noted
that a delightful-looking country house was flanked by two
portraits, the one being that of a pleasant-faced man in
a cricketing cap, while the other was a charming-looking girl
in V. A. D. uniform. In somewhat painful contrast below,
was a large photograph, evidently taken a great many years
ago, of a plain-looking woman in an old-fashioned wedding
dress.</p>

<p class='c008'>The barrister had mastered enough of the story to realize
that the handsome cricketer was Harry Garlett, the man
about to be tried for his life, and the sweet-faced young
nurse Jean Bower, the girl to whom Garlett was now engaged,
and who was supposed to have provided the motive
for his having poisoned his unattractive-looking wife.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>As for the central portrait—the counterfeit presentment
of himself—the caption which declared him to be “the most
famous criminal lawyer of our day” gave Sir Harold pleasure,
though it no longer bore the delicious thrill of novelty.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he laid the sheet down on his writing table, the door
opened and his clerk came in: “A young lady to see you, Sir
Harold. She says she would rather not give her name.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The great advocate looked sharply at his faithful henchman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose you told her that I only see people by appointment?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did tell her that, Sir Harold, but she said she did hope
you would break your rule this time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A nice young lady—a pretty young lady, Fulford?”
asked Sir Harold.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was fiddling about the papers which were on his table,
and he did not look at his clerk as he put the question.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, yes, Sir Harold, a very pretty young lady, quite
young, too, if you’ll excuse my mentioning it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right. Show her in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>While awaiting his visitor he idly opened a letter marked
“Urgent and confidential” which lay on the top of the pile
of envelopes.</p>

<p class='c008'>It contained the following words:</p>

<p class='c010'>It is because there are villains like you in the world ready to defend
any rascal, however guilty, that men murder women, trusting
to you to get them off.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another tribute to his marvellous gift of advocacy! He
read the ill-written sentence again, and it was with a broad
smile that he greeted the very charming-looking girl who
advanced nervously into the big, comfortably furnished
room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sit down,” he said with a kindly smile; and timidly his
visitor accepted his invitation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope you will not mind telling me your name? Remember,
my dear young lady, that wise people tell everything
to their doctor and their lawyer!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My name,” she said quietly, “is Jean Bower, and I am
engaged to be married to Mr. Henry Garlett.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>As she uttered these words, there was no trace of a smile
on her face, and it was then—for perhaps his knowledge of
human nature had not gone as far as he thought it had—that
Sir Harold Anstey realized for the first time that his visitor
looked unutterably sad. Had she not been so young, and,
yes, so attractive, he would have seen at once that she was
spent with anxiety and suffering.</p>

<p class='c008'>It must be admitted, though the fact did not redound to
his credit, that Sir Harold’s manner underwent a quick and
subtle change. It became, in place of deferential, familiar.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Although your coming to see me like this is not at all in
order, Miss Bower, I shall not be sorry to have a little talk
with you!” he exclaimed, moving his chair just a little
forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he did this, Jean Bower, unaware that she was doing
it, moved her chair just a little back.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And so,” he went on, in a jocular tone, “you are the
pretty young lady who has brought all this trouble about?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Poor Jean! She felt as if this man, whom she had
thought of as a friend, had struck her straight between the
eyes. She made no answer to the half-question, and only
gazed at him affrightedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are by profession a nurse, are you not?” he asked
abruptly. He felt annoyed that she had not “played up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I am not a nurse,” she spoke in a very low tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I have seen a picture of you, a very delightful picture,
it is, too!—in a nurse’s dress.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean Bower looked bewildered; then a painful flush came
over her face. She also, for her misfortune, had seen the
page now lying on Sir Harold’s table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The papers have published a head of me taken out of a
group of V. A. D.’s,” she said quickly. “I acted as secretary
for a while at a war hospital.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s why you were in France at the hospital to which
Harry Garlett was taken when wounded in 1917.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He thought he was on the right track at last.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” she said again, “I was never in France, I was in
a Manchester hospital in the later part of the war. I became
secretary to the Etna China Company last April, and as I
have not resigned my post, I am that now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She spoke with a certain simple directness.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“Then you were secretary to Mr. Garlett’s company, and
you also took care of his wife?” said the famous advocate,
again with a curious, not very pleasant, smile on his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are confusing me with Miss Cheale, who was Mrs.
Garlett’s housekeeper and companion,” said Jean.</p>

<p class='c008'>There had now come over her a terrible feeling of anxious
despondency, and of bitter, bitter disappointment. She had
expected the great man—he had been described to her as a
very great man by Mr. Toogood—to have the whole story
at his fingers’ ends, and to be, even in everyday life, an
ardent, as well as an eloquent, believer in his client’s innocence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Something of what was passing in her mind became apparent
to Sir Harold Anstey, and he felt sharply vexed with
himself. Vexed for having got the threads of the story so
wrong, and vexed, too, that he had broken through his rule
of never seeing, excepting at his own request, any one connected
with a forthcoming case.</p>

<p class='c008'>In his happy, prosperous everyday life Sir Harold rarely
came across any girls who seemed to him as prudish as the
girl now sitting facing him. Besides, with regard to this
girl, who had actually driven a man to commit murder for
love of her, such a pose was not only absurd, but very hypocritical.</p>

<p class='c008'>Still, as he had been foolish enough to see her, he told
himself that he might as well make the best of it, and improve
his own chances of winning what he was beginning to
see was going to be a very important case.</p>

<p class='c008'>His manner changed; it became, if not exactly more pleasant,
then shrewd and businesslike—what his visitor vaguely
described to herself as “sensible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want you to tell me in your own words,” he said impressively,
“the story of your acquaintance with Henry
Garlett, and what led up to your engagement.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Quietly, straightforwardly, and, he began almost to believe,
quite truthfully, Jean told the simple story of that
which had come to her to mean everything in the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>After she had finished Sir Harold leaned forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I accept all this as true, I must ask you a most important
question, Miss Bower. Who can have had the smallest
motive for wishing this lady out of the way? Remember
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>that in such a case as this, it is not enough to say, ‘This man
did not do it.’ You must, if you can in any way bring it
about, be able to declare, ‘But that man did!’ I suppose
we may put aside the idea that Mrs. Garlett committed
suicide?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose we may,” said Jean Bower, but she spoke
with a certain hesitation which he was quick to detect.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you any doubt of it?” he asked eagerly. “Did
the poor woman suffer great pain? What was her mental
state? Can we rely on her doctor to give evidence favourable
to Mr. Garlett?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dr. Maclean, who attended Mrs. Garlett, is my uncle,”
said the girl slowly. “I know that he believes, as does Mr.
Garlett himself, that such an idea as suicide never even
crossed her mind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Harold Anstey felt both perplexed and irritated. He
told himself that there is after all such a thing as being too
truthful, too scrupulous.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s a great pity,” he said dryly. “If you could persuade
your uncle, Miss Bower, to given even a slight hint
that his patient was sometimes very depressed and, if not
suffering actual pain, was yet in constant discomfort, it might
be a very great help to me in saving Mr. Garlett’s life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was still absolutely convinced that his client was
guilty, but somehow he was beginning to feel very, very
sorry for this pretty young creature with whom he was
holding this curiously unemotional conversation. While she
had been telling him the story of her acquaintanceship with
the man she now loved, he had suddenly realized that it was
pent-up passion, not lack of feeling, that made her speak in
so still and quiet a voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So far no arsenic has been traced to Henry Garlett’s
possession, and of course that is a point in his favour,” he
said musingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose that it is quite impossible that sugar and arsenic
can be substituted by accident the one for the other?” asked
Jean. “I mean at a grocer’s, for instance?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quite impossible,” he said firmly. “But tell me why
you ask the question?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because Mrs. Garlett seems to have had some strawberries
smothered in white sugar just before her supper.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>“Did she say the strawberries had made her ill?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean knitted her white forehead.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not that I know of. But Miss Cheale, the lady who was
her companion-nurse, at first put down her illness to her
having eaten them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your uncle, I take it, lives close to the Thatched House.
Does he make up his own medicines?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean Bower shook her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He did so, I believe, when he first bought the practice,
but he gave up doing it years ago.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I take it that everything connected with the dispensary
was swept away?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A garage has been put up in the place where he used
to make up the medicines.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is there a chemist’s shop near by?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” said Jean quickly. “But the daughter of my
uncle’s predecessor, a lady called Miss Prince, keeps certain
simple medicines in her house, which she gives to the village
people.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Harold made a note of the name on his blotting paper.
“I suppose we may take it,” he observed, “that that lady
had no arsenic in her possession?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If she had, I feel sure she would have said so,” said
Jean. “As a matter of fact, she is Mr. Garlett’s tenant.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How old is Miss Prince?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should think she must be about sixty——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see. Now, Miss Bower, I must ask you a delicate
question. Can you think of any young woman, apart from
yourself, who was on friendly terms with Mr. Garlett at the
time of his wife’s death?”</p>

<p class='c008'>To his surprise the girl became first distressingly red and
then very pale. A struggle was going on in her mind. Had
the big, florid man sitting opposite to her been just a little
other than he was, she would have forced herself to tell
him of the curious, as she believed utterly untrue, gossip,
concerning her lover’s meeting with some mysterious young
woman in the wood. But somehow she could not bring herself
to mention the sordid story to Sir Harold Anstey.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” she said at last. “I can think of nobody; indeed
I’m quite sure there was nobody.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at his watch.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“I should like you to wait while I glance over the brief.
It contains a précis of the Garlett case.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He handed her an unopened daily paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Try to forget what I am doing,” he said kindly. “Switch
your mind right off it! We shall get along much better
when I have mastered the principal points of the story.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Deliberately he turned his back on her, and she did her
best to follow his advice.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seemed an eternity to Jean Bower, but it was not more
than twenty minutes before Sir Harold Anstey put the wad
of sheets he had been holding down on the table and turned
toward her, an ugly, sneering frown on his broad, shrewd
face.</p>

<p class='c008'>How extraordinary that this simple country chit should
have so bamboozled him! If angry with her, he was also
angry with himself, and so, though he did not wish to
frighten her, it was in a very cold cutting voice that he observed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see, Miss Bower, that a witness, Lucy Warren by name,
will be called by the Crown to prove that before his wife’s
death you were in the habit of meeting Henry Garlett secretly
at night in a wood close to his house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lucy Warren!” exclaimed Jean Bower, in a tone of utter
surprise, as well as of dismayed horror.</p>

<p class='c008'>She went on excitedly: “We used to wonder who could
have told that wicked lie. No one would tell me, not even
Mr. Kentworthy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her eyes filled with tears; instinctively she covered her
face with her hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great advocate told himself that he was not in the
least moved by this display of emotion. Your unsuccessful
liar, especially if she be a woman, often covers up her confusion
at being found out by shedding quite genuine tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am sure you understand,” he said firmly, “that this
fact, which you very foolishly and dishonourably—if you will
forgive my saying so—concealed from me just now, puts a
far more serious complexion on our side of the case.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see what you mean,” she said in a low voice; and she
looked so unutterably miserable that, in spite of himself,
the man’s heart softened.</p>

<p class='c008'>After all, she was a very pretty little girl—far more pitiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>and appealing, now that she was showing distress and emotion,
than she had appeared when so coldly restrained.
He told himself that it was rather beastly that he, Harold
Anstey, who was so fortunate, so prosperous, and, as a rule,
such a lucky dog with women, should allow himself to be
vexed that he had been taken in—for once!</p>

<p class='c008'>He suddenly began to feel kindly, protective, generous,
as well as again shrewdly alive to the importance of winning
what was evidently going to be a very big case.</p>

<p class='c008'>He got up and came and put his big right hand on her
slender shoulder: “Now, look here, my dear——?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She shrank back a little, then drying her eyes, she looked
up at him, fearlessly and bravely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am going to do my very best to save your lover’s life.
But you, on your side, must make up your mind to be absolutely
truthful with me—eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will be, Sir Harold—indeed I will be!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we may take it, I suppose, that it was a case of
love at first sight; that Mr. Garlett was taken with you from
the first (as well he might be!) and then he did persuade
you, wrongly I admit, to meet him at night in this wood?
When I say night, I am well aware that it was not really
night. From what this young servant says, she had to be
in by ten, so that fixes the time. Can you give me any kind
of reason why you should have met him? Any reason
you can think of, or even—hum!—invent, will be of value.
I realize that you were working with Mr. Garlett, and that
you had plenty to talk about of a—well! ordinary, straightforward
kind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean Bower got up from her chair so suddenly that he felt
startled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know if anything I say will convince you that I
am telling the truth,” she said desperately. “But I swear
to you most solemnly before God that I never met Mr. Garlett,
either before his wife’s death or since, secretly at night,
in that wood or anywhere else. What is more, I am convinced
that he never did such a thing, and I can’t believe that
Lucy Warren thinks that he did!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was impressed in spite of himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What sort of a girl is Lucy Warren? Do you know
her?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>“I know her quite well. In fact, the day before Mrs.
Garlett’s death I was actually present when, as a result of
something she had done, she was given notice to leave the
Thatched House.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I admit,” said Sir Harold slowly, “that that does provide
from our point of view a useful complication. The evidence
of a dismissed servant is always regarded as tainted.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked, for the first time, really puzzled and ill at
ease.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me see,” he said. “Kentworthy, who was for so
many years employed by the Home Office, is the detective
we are employing, isn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean Bower came up closer to him. Somehow she no
longer felt afraid of this big, to her singularly unattractive-looking,
man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We all like Mr. Kentworthy, and I am sure he is honest.
But oh! he is not a clever man, Sir Harold. The only thing
that makes me happy to be with him”—tears came into her
voice—“is that even now he does believe Harry to be innocent.
He really does—I do wish you believed it too!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was taken aback, touched, and rather amused, by her
frankness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How dare you accuse me of not believing in the innocence
of a man I’m going to defend?” he exclaimed half jokingly.
“Of course I believe my client to be innocent until he is
proved guilty!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sir Harold,” she said piteously, “tell me if I can help
Harry in any way? Is there nothing—nothing that I can
do? I would do anything.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sit down,” he said briefly.</p>

<p class='c008'>She sat down, and he began walking up and down the
room. Though she did not know it, that was a good sign.
It showed that he was becoming really interested, putting
his powerful mind to the solution of a problem that was
not, after all, as simple as he had believed it to be.</p>

<p class='c008'>If this girl told the truth—if her relations with this man
she now passionately loved had been what she had just sworn
them to have been before his wife’s death—then what could
have been Garlett’s motive in poisoning the poor woman?
He was also impressed by the detective Kentworthy’s belief
in Garlett’s innocence.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Sir Harold Anstey had had a great deal to do with Kentworthy
in another murder mystery case and it had been
Kentworthy’s passionless, honest, clear evidence in the box
which had hanged Anstey’s guilty client. Kentworthy might
not be a clever man—not the Sherlock Holmes every young
lady expects a detective to be—but his opinion, especially
when it was in favour of a man actually under arrest on a
charge of murder, was of great value in the famous barrister’s
eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is going to be a very difficult, complicated, and
anxious case,” he said at last. “All the more difficult because
it appears so absolutely simple.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He saw a look of astonishment flash across Jean Bower’s
flushed face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To you,” he exclaimed, “who believe this man to be
innocent, the case is perfectly simple. But if we can produce
nothing better than what we have now got, Miss Bower,
judge, jury, in fact——” he hesitated and then went on
firmly, “everyone in the case will believe that Harry Garlett
undoubtedly poisoned his late wife.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She answered in a low voice: “I do understand that,” and
though she did not flinch, a sensation of numb despair took
possession of her heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It follows that we must produce something, anything,
that will shake the belief of those on whose opinion, Miss
Bower, your lover’s life will hang as by a thread.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She stared at him, fascinated. The real power of the
man was beginning to impress her, to make her feel a kind of
confidence in him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He stopped in his pacing and gazed fixedly down into her
troubled, quivering, upturned face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you give me your word of honour that you will
never reveal to anybody the fact that I gave you, personally,
any advice concerning your own association with the case?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I give you my word of honour,” she said quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is because I believe you will keep it,” he said seriously,
“that I am going to tell you how I think you can help your
lover.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She waited silently till he spoke again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am one of the few people in my line of life who believe
in the amateur detective—and especially in the woman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>amateur detective. Not for nothing were the most dangerous
spies in the great war—women.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A look of pain came into Jean Bower’s face. Unheeding
of that, he went on, weighing his words:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Kentworthy can be trusted thoroughly to get up a case
of the straightforward, normal kind. But for this sort of
delicate, difficult, dangerous work, I fear he is of little use.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He wheeled round, and once more began walking up and
down the long room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now I’m going to assume that you are right, Miss
Bower—that Henry Garlett is absolutely innocent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned and cast a quick, measuring glance at his
visitor.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was wondering, deep in his heart, if she really did
absolutely believe in Garlett’s innocence? If not, he was not
only wasting valuable time, but they two were playing at a
tiresome game of make-believe.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then she said so humbly, so touchingly, “Thank you,
Sir Harold,” that he felt his question answered.</p>

<p class='c008'>He went on speaking, swaying slightly as he did so, wholly
absorbed in the problem before him. “If this man is innocent,
then we must concentrate on the fact that some one
else is guilty of the crime of which he is accused. Some
human being—man or woman—gave Mrs. Emily Garlett a
large dose of arsenic with intent to kill her.” He looked
at her fixedly. “Now who was that person? It is up to
you, Miss Bower, to find that out, and you have only a month
and a few days to do it in, so there’s no time to lose.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me how to set about it,” exclaimed Jean Bower,
“and I’ll do exactly what you tell me to do!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder if you will?” he exclaimed. “I know you
mean now to do what I advise, but the worst of amateurs is
that they are prone to act from the heart rather than from
the head. You won’t like the first job I’m going to put
you to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will do anything,” she said firmly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait till you hear what it is! The moment you get
back to Terriford get an order to see Mr. Garlett alone, or
within sight, but not within hearing, of a warder. And
then, however disagreeable the job, you must get out of him
whether or not this Lucy Warren told the truth concerning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>his mysterious interviews with some woman in the wood
near his house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am absolutely sure it is a lie!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Harold shook his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This won’t do at all. If you begin by assuring him that
you are sure he never did such a thing—then he will find
it impossible to admit that he did do it. What you must
say is that you can see no reason in the world why he
shouldn’t have met and walked with some young lady.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How can I do that when I feel sure he never did do it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at her kindly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Forgive me, Miss Bower! I was a fool to think that
you could bring yourself to act the part of even the most
amateur of detectives. Put the idea out of your mind, and
rest assured that I will do everything in my power to save
your lover’s life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean rose from her chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, no, no!” she cried, “of course I’ll do exactly what
you advise. I’ll tell Harry that his meeting a girl in that
way and in that place was not so very strange—nay, more,
I’ll try and force myself to believe it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right,” he said heartily, “now you’re acting like a
brave, sensible girl, and not like a foolish, obstinate woman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But supposing he says it was all an invention of Lucy
Warren’s——?” She looked at him anxiously. “Then I
suppose I must get Lucy Warren to say she told a lie?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, that will be the next step, and if you fail I shall succeed
when I have got her in the witness-box,” he said grimly.
“That is supposing she <i>did</i> tell a lie. But, Miss Bower——?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Suppose that Garlett admits that he did meet a lady in
the wood—what then?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He answered his own question.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have then what we are looking for—a second human
being with an interest in Mrs. Garlett’s death. I suppose,”
he said suddenly, “that it has not occurred to you that the
young woman may have been no other than Lucy Warren
herself?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There are things, Sir Harold, which I suppose even you
would admit are impossible,” she said quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at her, and remained silent. How make this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>girl understand that innumerable men of a superior social
caste have made love, will make love, are making love all
the time, to girls like Lucy Warren? From the moment he
had read the notes made by Kentworthy, he had asked himself
whether after all, Lucy Warren, in her obstinate determination
not to reveal the name of the woman with whom
she said she had seen her master, might not have had the
very best of reasons for her obstinacy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We will suppose,” he went on, measuring his words,
“that Mr. Garlett, while admitting he was in the wood,
refuses to give up the name of his companion. Well, if you
fail to extract that information from Lucy Warren you
must try and think of some other way of discovering who
the woman was. To do that, you must, if you will forgive
the expression, stick at nothing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She said timidly: “I suppose you’ve seen the anonymous
letters—the letters which started the whole trouble?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The anonymous letters?” he exclaimed. “There isn’t a
word about them here!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Harold Anstey went over to his writing table and sat
down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you copies of these letters in your possession?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I have them here,” she said in a low voice, “but I
don’t want to get Mr. Kentworthy into trouble, Sir Harold.
I’m afraid he ought not to have kept these facsimiles.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank God, he did! Show them to me at once.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He spoke in a peremptory tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean Bower opened her bag and silently laid the three
sheets of paper before him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He bent over them for what seemed to her a very long
time, but at last he looked up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a monstrous thing,” he exclaimed, “that these were
not put in among the exhibits connected with the case.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So Mr. Kentworthy says,” observed Jean. “He thinks
them an integral part of the story—that was his expression.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Bower?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned, and faced her squarely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Find the human being who wrote these three dastardly
letters—and I will undertake to save your lover’s life!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>As she walked away from the great advocate’s chambers
Jean Bower felt happier than she had felt since the
terrible morning when Harry Garlett had been arrested in
her presence on the charge of murder.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though she felt certain that her forthcoming interview
with Garlett would not bring the result Sir Harold evidently
expected it to do, yet, deep in her heart, she was full of joy
at the thought of seeing the man she loved. Her heart had
hungered for him, and nothing but the knowledge that he
shrank from seeing her in the shameful place where he was
now strictly confined had prevented her making an effort
to see him. It was an infinite comfort to feel that it was
now her duty to do so.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had deliberately sent no word of her approaching
return to Bonnie Doon, and when she went out of Grendon
station, where she had always been met by either her uncle
or her aunt, even by Elsie if neither of them could come,
there swept over her a curious feeling that henceforth she
must live her life alone, if only because of her promise to the
man on whose instructions she was now acting.</p>

<p class='c008'>Quickly she walked away from the station, intent on seeing
Mr. Toogood, so that her interview with Harry Garlett
should be arranged as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when she turned into the High Street of the busy
country town she became aware that she had been recognized
by certain of the people who had passed her, and by the time
she had reached the lawyer’s office some ten to twenty men
and women were dogging her footsteps.</p>

<p class='c008'>She began to feel like a hunted thing, and oh, the relief
of finding herself in the hall of the house where she had
come with her uncle on the day her lover had been arrested.</p>

<p class='c008'>This time Jean was shown straight into the room where
Mr. Toogood, the last time she was here, had remained
closeted with her uncle for so long.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>She went, as was her nature, straight to the point.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have made up my mind to ask for an order to see Mr.
Garlett,” she said quietly. “And I should be grateful if you
would tell him, Mr. Toogood, that it is because I have to
speak to him on a matter of importance that I’m doing what
I know he does not wish me to do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve always thought his attitude as to that quite unreasonable,”
said the lawyer in a decided tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How would you like Mrs. Toogood or your daughter
to see you in prison?” asked Jean in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s something in that—especially as I suppose you
realize, Miss Bower, that you won’t see Mr. Garlett alone?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought perhaps that as I want to see him on private
business, I would be granted the privilege of seeing him
alone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He shook his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is no country in the world, Miss Bower, where
such privileges are extended to a prisoner under remand.
I, as Mr. Garlett’s legal adviser, have free private access to
him. But you cannot expect the same privilege. Whatever
you have to say to him will be said in the presence of
two warders.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He saw that this was a great surprise to her, and she
looked deeply troubled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” he exclaimed. “I’ll put the
case to the Governor. I suppose you’ve met him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I remember that he was in the cricket pavilion at that
big match last May, and I even had a talk with him. But
I don’t suppose he’ll remember me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You do yourself an injustice!” exclaimed the old lawyer
gallantly. “I expect Colonel Brackbury remembers you
very well indeed. In any case I will put the matter to him
personally. I take it, Miss Bower,” he looked at her hard,
“that you really require to see Mr. Garlett on business?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I would willingly tell you why I wish to see him, but
I have given my word to tell no one.” She hesitated, and
then, “I have been asked to put a certain question to him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Kentworthy making the poor girl do his dirty work,”
thought Mr. Toogood. Aloud he observed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, my dear young lady, I’ll see what can be done.
I know the Governor will stretch a point if he can. He is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>on very cordial terms with your uncle, and I seem to remember
that he’s a regular cricket maniac. Funny, isn’t it, that
such things should make any difference? But they do!
I’ve found out that the lawyer who doesn’t allow for the
oddities of human nature makes a great mistake—I mean
professionally. I hope you’ve left every one quite well at
home, eh?—I mean at Bonnie Doon?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve been in London,” she answered, “so I haven’t seen
them since the day before yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That fixes it!” said the lawyer to himself. “I wonder
what Kentworthy wants that poor girl to get out of Garlett?
Surely he’s never told her to find out who was in the wood
with him? That would be hard on her. Yet he may be
beginning to see what I’ve always seen, that Garlett’s one
hope is to bring some other woman into the case.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They both got up; he strolled across to his window, and
saw with dismay that a crowd had gathered below on the
broad pavement, waiting for the heroine of the Terriford
Mystery to appear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Haven’t you got a car?” he asked, surprised.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought of walking home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No need to do that,” he said kindly. “I’ll telephone
and ask my daughter to bring our car along. She’ll get you
to Bonnie Doon in no time! Meanwhile, will you go into
the other room for a minute? I have a private message to
give her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Slightly surprised, Jean did as he asked her. Then, when
he had got through to his house, he said: “Is that you,
Kitty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Father.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want you to run the car along here. Are you listening?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Listening hard, Father!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good! Now don’t come through the High Street.
You’ve got to make your way somehow into Juniper Alley,
to the back of this house. There’s a crowd gathered at the
front door waiting for that poor child, Jean Bower, to come
out. I want to get her away without any one seeing her.
You’ll only have to drive her to Bonnie Doon. It won’t
take you long.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he brought his young visitor back to his room.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>“Now, look here, my dear, we’ve got about ten minutes
before my daughter can be here, and I haven’t had an opportunity
of seeing you alone since we met—you remember
when? I want to tell you to be of good heart! It’s a tremendously
important point on your side—I wonder if you
realize how important?—that no arsenic has been traced to
Harry Garlett’s possession. What’s more, poor Mrs. Garlett
was poisoned with <i>white</i> arsenic. We’ve got one of the
biggest poison experts in the world ready to go into the box
and swear that Mrs. Garlett was poisoned with pure arsenic,
not arsenic extracted from some article in common use.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked at him gratefully, but remained silent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then there’s another point,” he went on. “A great deal
has been made of those strawberries which were eaten by
Mrs. Garlett on the fatal evening. As a matter of fact, no
one saw her eat them, and no one has the slightest idea who
brought them into her room. It’s very unfortunate that your
uncle conveyed the impression, as he certainly did, that he
knew as a fact that Mrs. Garlett received those strawberries
from her husband’s hand. He knew nothing of the kind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve never been able to understand the question of the
strawberries, and why so much importance has been attached
to them,” said Jean Bower in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Importance has been attached to them,” said the lawyer
decidedly, “because they seem to have been the only vehicle
by which the poison could have been administered. The
Prosecution have two witnesses ready to swear that they
saw the small dish of strawberries, sprinkled thickly with
powdered sugar, outside Mrs. Garlett’s door at five o’clock,
and that at seven o’clock the dish was no longer there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How strange,” said Jean in an oppressed tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Garlett denies having even seen the strawberries.
The lawyer who took Miss Cheale’s evidence on commission
received from her the assurance that she did not know who
had given Mrs. Garlett the fruit—she simply assumed that
it must have been Mr. Garlett. Sir Harold Anstey—you
will remember I told you about him last time you were in
this room—will certainly make the most of the fact that no
one knows what happened to those strawberries! Not only
the fruit, but the dish, one of a set of four, disappeared from
the top of the chest of drawers where it was known to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>been that afternoon. The apparent obliteration of the dish
is a very curious circumstance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose it is,” said Jean doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That odd occurrence, coupled with the fact that no
purchase of arsenic has been traced to our friend, will certainly
be an important point in his favour, so you must keep
up heart.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I try to,” said Jean. “I’m feeling happier——”</p>

<p class='c008'>She stopped short. She had nearly said “now that I have
seen Sir Harold Anstey.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Toogood looked at his watch.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Kitty will be waiting for you now.” He opened the door,
and then, to her surprise, said a little hurriedly: “No, not
downstairs, but upstairs, Miss Bower! My daughter prefers
driving up to the back of the house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As he uttered these lying words, he was leading her up the
staircase, she bewildered but obedient. When they reached
the top story he led her down a passage, and then they
walked silently down what had been the back stairs of the old
mansion when it was a dwelling-house. Once on the ground
floor, he took her rapidly through a small paved court into a
kind of little alley, where the car stood waiting.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-bye, Miss Jean! I’ll see if I can catch the Governor
to-day, and then your interview will take place, if it
can be managed, to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not often that Mr. Toogood felt a pang of curiosity.
As a rule, lawyers know too much, not too little, of
their clients’ affairs. But he did wonder very much what it
was that Kentworthy had asked Jean Bower to find out. He
felt sure that she would fail in her task. Harry Garlett was
the last man to be persuaded to say anything he did not wish
to say, and if he had indeed been holding clandestine meetings
in the wood with some woman whose name he alone
knew, he would certainly not “give the lady away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Toogood chuckled a little as he found his way back to
his room, remembering that his good friend, Colonel Brackbury,
Governor of His Majesty’s Prison at Grendon, had
said to him only two days before:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I feel interested in Jean Bower. I thought her a most
attractive girl! We had quite a talk at that cricket match
last spring. I should very much like to see her again.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Late that same afternoon Elsie put her head through the
door of the dining room of Bonnie Doon.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ye’re wanted on the telephone, Miss Jean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Would you rather I went, my dear?” asked her aunt
kindly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll go,” said the girl quickly. “I think I know who it is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And, sure enough, it was Mr. Toogood.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s all right, Miss Bower. If you will be at the prison at
ten o’clock to-morrow morning, the Governor will himself be
present at your interview with Mr. Garlett. He says he will
keep out of earshot. I hope you are pleased.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am indeed,” she called back, “and very grateful to
you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then she walked back slowly to the room where her
uncle and aunt were sitting. She was sorry, now, that she
had not confided to them her intention of seeing Harry
Garlett, but she had shrunk from doing so, for she knew they
were hurt with her for concealing the reason of her visit to
London.</p>

<p class='c008'>As she opened the door she said abruptly: “I am going
to see Harry to-morrow morning. I called at Mr. Toogood’s
office on my way home and arranged it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As neither of them spoke, she went on, catching her breath
a little:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Try not to mind my not being able to tell you why I
want to see him. I’ve promised not to do so—but it is important.
It may make a difference at the trial.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a pause, and then Mrs. Maclean said a little
coldly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Neither your uncle nor I wish to interfere in your private
affairs, my dear. You are grown up, and you have a right
to do as you please. But your uncle has a very wide knowledge
of life, and I think you would probably find that, in the
long run, it would be worth your while to take him into your
confidence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean burst into bitter sobs, and her aunt got up from her
chair and put her arms around her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, come, don’t be offended, childie! It’s only that
we’re so anxious—that’s all. The matter’s so terribly important,
not only to you but to your uncle—perhaps you don’t
quite realize that, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>“How d’you mean?” exclaimed Jean, glancing from the
one to the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” said Dr. Maclean slowly, “I’ve not said anything
about it, for I’ve known that your trouble, my dear, has been
much, much greater than mine. But of course this terrible
affair is a fearful blow to my professional reputation. And
though for a little while people will be eager to see me—after
I’ve been badgered and worried like a rat worried by a
terrier, in the witness-box—the better class of my patients
are sure to say: ‘Better not send for old Maclean. D’you
remember that stupid mistake he made over the death certificate
of that patient of his who was poisoned?’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t realize all that. Oh, how sorry I am that I’ve
brought all this awful trouble on you!” exclaimed Jean,
looking from the one to the other of them with unhappy,
haunted eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the first time since this great trouble had come on
them all, they separated that evening not on their usual
affectionate, open terms, the one with the other. And it was
after a night spent wide awake in bitter self-communing that
Jean got up early the next morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll breakfast with you in the kitchen,” she said to Elsie.
“I’ve got to be at the prison by ten o’clock, and I should
like to get out of the house before my uncle and aunt come
downstairs.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The modern prison of Grendon was built at a time in the
nineteenth century when there was still but small reverence
for historic buildings. Within the vast enclosure surrounded
by walls five feet thick still stands the mound crowned by the
ruins of a Norman keep known to antiquaries as Grendon
Castle. And close to that high mound rises the mediæval
mass of brick and stone locally called the Old Prison. To
the imaginative historian that house of woe, long emptied
though it be of suffering humanity, is of far greater interest
than are the remains of the castle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Last, but, from the point of view of the townspeople, by
far the most important, within the same vast enceinte is the
eighteenth-century pillared building where the county assizes
are always held, and where many a famous trial has taken
place. But the public doors to the Assize Court are reached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>from without the great walls, some way from the jealously
guarded entrance to the modern prison, and to the vast space
in which it stands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Till comparatively lately, the public were freely admitted
to what is still called the Castle yard, and public meetings of
deep import to the state were held there. But now it is
difficult to obtain even permission to visit the Castle ruins
and the Old Prison.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean Bower had walked quickly through the keen morning
air, and so, being full half an hour early, she paced up and
down for what seemed a long time under the stout walls;
at last, when her watch told her it was a quarter to ten,
she rang the bell of the small postern door cut into the great
gate.</p>

<p class='c008'>There came the sound of footsteps on stone flags, the
clanking of big keys, and then the door was opened by a
gray-haired man in uniform.</p>

<p class='c008'>Taking the admission order from her hand, he glanced
over it, and looked at her with quickened interest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re a bit early, if I may say so,” he said kindly, “but
you follow me, miss, and I’ll see what I can do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As she walked under the vaulted gateway, past the quaint
little opening which evidently led into her guide’s home, Jean
found herself on the edge of a vast paved enclosure.</p>

<p class='c008'>To her left rose the huge mound, and in front of the
mound, as if cut out of the paving stones, was a round lawn
of closely cropped turf.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, gradually, she became aware that behind a row of
tall, now leafless, plane trees was a strange-looking building
of dark red brick and gray stone. There was something
stark and desolate about the irregular outline which showed
sharply clear against the pale blue of the winter sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her companion followed the direction of her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ay, that’s the Old Prison,” he observed. “Folk used to
come from a long way to go over that place, but now it isn’t
shown—ever. But as you’ve got a few minutes to spare,
miss, maybe you’d like to have a look at it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He took her assent for granted, and slowly they began
walking straight toward what Jean now knew to be a very
famous place—famous if only because it had been the first
prison visited by Elizabeth Fry.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>“Where is the real prison?” she asked hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You turn yourself right around-about and you’ll see it
clear enough.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned quickly, and beyond the Castle mound, far to
the right, she saw a large, commonplace-looking yellow brick
building which reminded her of a modern factory. The
knowledge that Harry Garlett was there gave her a stab of
pain. Quickly she turned away and once more stared at the
sinister-looking Old Prison, and it was with a thrill of surprise
that she saw that the low doors giving access to the
dark, grimy-looking building were all wide open.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should be afraid to come here at night,” she exclaimed.
“That place looks as if it were haunted.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re not the only one to say that. My wife wouldn’t
go in the Old Prison not after dark—for a hundred pounds!
It’s said that on All-Hallows Eve one ’ears groans and awful
moanings agoing on the whole night. However, I’ve never
been there to see, and bless you! people are sure to say them
sort of things about that sort of place. Now you come along—and
I’ll show you what many a lady in Grendon would
give a good bit to see.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He moved on, his bunch of keys clanging in his big hands
as he walked, till they came right up to the widest of the
low entrances to the deserted building.</p>

<p class='c008'>The black oak iron bound door had been clamped back to
the wall, leaving the way in clear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d best go in first,” said the porter; and Jean, following
him, found herself almost at once in pitch-darkness,
groping along a narrow passage. Suddenly he took out of
his pocket and turned on an electric torch. But that only
seemed to make more dense the thick-feeling blackness,
though it enabled Jean to see that on each side of the passage
were tiny, windowless cells. Was it possible that human
beings had ever been confined in such holes as that?</p>

<p class='c008'>They walked on and on along the lightless, airless burrows,
and once the girl stumbled badly on the uneven earthen floor.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last the porter stayed his steps and held up his hand;
she saw it gleaming redly against the bright white light cast
by his torch.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is the place folk most wants to come and gloat
over,” he observed in a half joking tone.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>They were on the threshold of a low vaulted chamber, and
a moment later he and Jean were standing in the middle of
the otherwise empty, windowless crypt-like room, by what
looked like an enormous kitchen table, excepting that it was
made of stone. Jean’s guide threw the light of his torch
right on to the gray, stained surface, and she saw that into
the stone two deep ruts had been cut, one each way.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Folk were drawn and quartered on this ’ere table,”
he explained, “and not so very long ago, missie! The last
lot done ’ere was a batch of what they called ‘the rebels,’
those Scotchies who reckoned they wanted another king.
Just before my time they used to keep ’ere, careless-like
on the table, the big knife and fork with which they quartered
the poor wretches. But now they’re put away in
what’s called Grendon Museum.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As if talking to himself, he went on musingly: “’Anging’s
a sight more merciful than the old ways they ’ad of doing
men and women to death. That I always will maintain.
But a ’anging’s a gruesome sight. Maybe we’ll have time
for me to take you just round to see the gallows. Leastways
you won’t see much! Only a kind of platform, you
know—that’s where they’re turned off. It’s just off the new
prison.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then the good man felt considerably startled, for
the girl he had supposed to be by his side staring down at
the stone table had disappeared!</p>

<p class='c008'>He flashed his torchlight round the stone walls, and with
relief perceived that she was leaning up against the side of
the arched entrance which gave into the black passage way.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her face was drawn, and very pale, and all at once he
remembered her relation with the man who, it was confidently
expected by most of the people connected with Grendon
Prison, would be the next poor wretch to be “turned
off.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bless my soul!” he exclaimed, “I oughtn’t to have said
that. I clean forgot about your friend, missie. What a fool
I am to be sure!”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a tone of deep dismay and regret in the voice
in which he uttered these words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m all right now,” Jean said faintly. “I suddenly felt
queer. I think the air must be very bad in this place.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>“Of course it is,” he agreed, “no draught through.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then he went on, this time in a very serious voice,
“As I’ve said so much, miss, I’ll say just one thing more to
ye——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes?” she said questioningly, standing away from the
door. She had no idea what he was going to say, and yet
somehow she felt horribly afraid.</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Anging, as now practised,” he observed, “is a very merciful
form of death. It isn’t ’anging at all, so to speak—they
just breaks the poor chap’s neck and it’s all over in a
second! ’E don’t know it’s ’appening till it ’as ’appened—if
you take my meaning?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She “took his meaning” only too well, and, with a wild
wish to escape from her now torturing thoughts, she turned
out of that awful room of death, and almost ran along the
cavernous way and so out into the fresh air.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her guide followed, uncertain whether he had been right
or wrong in saying what he had last said to her. “But
there!” he said to himself, “the poor little missie may be
glad to remember it some March morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But when he saw her face in the daylight, he exclaimed,
“Dang me! The wife’s right! I do talk too much—that
I do.” And then, shamefacedly, he added: “Best say nothing
of my having shown you a bit of the Old Prison, eh? I
mean to the Governor?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I won’t,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon they reached the great gate, and then the man took
hold of Jean Bower’s arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mary Ann,” he called out.</p>

<p class='c008'>A tall thin woman came out: “Yes?” she said acidly,
“what d’you want, John?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give this young lady a drop o’ that brandy I’ve got in
the cupboard. Give it her neat—no water, Mary Ann!
That Old Prison of ours ’as turned ’er over queer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The woman gave a quick look at Jean, and then she ran
indoors. A moment later she came back, a small glass in
her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hardly knowing what she was doing, the girl gulped down
the brandy. Almost at once she felt better, and the colour
came back into her face.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Jean Bower sat in the waiting room of what was
called the New Prison. Though she was clad in a warm
fur cloak which had just been given her by her uncle and
aunt, she felt dreadfully cold. She was miserably anxious
and uneasy as to her coming interview with Harry Garlett.
How could she ask the man she loved so degrading a question—how
make him understand the great importance all
those concerned with his defence attached to what she took
to be a lying bit of low gossip?</p>

<p class='c008'>The door of the waiting room opened and Colonel Brackbury
walked in.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Bower? I had the pleasure of meeting you early
last May.” And then he shook hands with her warmly.
But although he was touched at his visitor’s look of deep
sadness and at the pallor of her young face, he hardened
himself to say that which he knew must be said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have stretched a great point in assenting to your wish
for what practically amounts to a private interview with
Henry Garlett. I must ask you to give me your solemn
word of honour that you will not hand him, or try to convey
to him, anything surreptitiously. Also that you will not
make the slightest attempt to approach him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“To approach him?” echoed Jean uncertainly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There will be a table between Mr. Garlett and yourself.
You must not stretch across it and try to shake hands with
him, for instance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I quite understand, and I promise to do what you ask.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some time ago a lady was allowed to see her husband,
who, like Mr. Garlett, was as yet untried. Although a
warder was present at the interview she managed, unseen by
the warder, to roll along the floor toward her husband a
small ball containing a dose of prussic acid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at her significantly, but Jean made no comment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>It was to her as if she was living through some awful
nightmare.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understand that you desire to see Henry Garlett with
reference to some matter concerning his defence?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She answered in a strangled tone: “But for that I should
not have asked to see him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should like you to know,” he said kindly, “that we are
doing everything we can to make Mr. Garlett comfortable. In
our country a man is accounted absolutely innocent until he is
adjudged guilty. Apart from the irksomeness of the confinement,
and the not being able to see his friends freely, Mr.
Garlett is leading much the same life as he would lead outside,
were he, what of course he is not, a recluse. I am taking
special pains to see that he has good and nourishing food.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, rather to his surprise, for he really knew very
little about human nature, Jean Bower began to cry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, come,” he said dismayed, “this won’t do! You
must do your best to hearten him up, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will,” she whispered, “I will indeed.” And then she
added a pathetic word. “I didn’t think you would be so
kind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not kind,” he exclaimed testily. “I’m only doing my
duty. There! That’s right”—for she was trying to smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then they started walking down what seemed to the
girl interminable cold, clean, bare passages. But at last they
passed through a baize door into what had once been the
Governor’s official residence before the pleasant villa which
the Brackburys occupied had been built, and where were
now situated the prison offices.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Governor opened the door of a large room and courteously
stood aside to allow her to pass in. And then suddenly
Jean, through a mist of blinding tears, saw Harry
Garlett.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was standing close to the wall behind a long narrow
table to her left. For a moment she thought him unchanged;
and then she saw that all the healthy, outdoor-man look had
gone, and that there was an awful air of strain in the eyes
which seemed the only thing alive in his pale set face.</p>

<p class='c008'>A fire was burning at the other end of the room, but it was
very cold, and the atmosphere was full of the musty feeling
of an uninhabited room.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Colonel Brackbury brought over a chair for Jean to sit
upon. Then, looking from the girl to his prisoner, he said:
“And now I will leave you to your talk, Miss Bower. You
see that door over there? I shall be close to it, reading my
paper, and I shall not be able to hear anything you say
unless you raise your voices.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He walked quickly down the long room, and Jean sat
down on the chair he had provided for her.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a few moments neither of them said anything. She
sat, with downcast eyes, trying to repress the tears which
would come in spite of her effort to keep them back, while
he, poor wretch, gazed at her, all his soul in his sunken eyes
remembering.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last she whispered: “You don’t mind my having come?
There is a real reason, Harry, or I would not have done it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was only because I didn’t feel I could bear the thought
of your coming to such a place that I wrote as I did,” he
answered in a low voice. “But, oh, how glad I am to see
you now.” Sinking his voice yet further, he whispered, “My
darling, darling love.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She felt as if the sobs she must repress would strangle
her utterance. But at last she managed to say: “I have
come to ask you to tell me something——” She stopped,
not knowing how to word her stupid, her unnecessary, her
insulting question.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” he said eagerly. “Ask me anything in the world,
Jean.” And then, as she at last looked up, and he saw the
lines that pain and acute suspense had written on her face,
he gave a low groan.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, my God!” he exclaimed, “I can’t bear your looking
like this, Jean. Mrs. Maclean told me you were quite well.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She said quietly: “I am quite well. But I lay awake last
night thinking of to-day. I’m so afraid”—she waited,
then began again—“I’m so dreadfully afraid that you’ll be
angry—that you won’t understand. But the question I’ve
come to ask you is supposed to be so important. And yet?
Oh, Harry——”</p>

<p class='c008'>He broke in: “What is it? Come, Jean, you’ve nothing
to be afraid of! You could never make me angry—surely
you know that? Whatever you ask me I’ll answer truthfully.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>“The other side have a witness,” she murmured in a low
strained voice, “who will swear that she saw you at night in
the wood which joins part of your garden, with a young
woman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of the quick, contemptuous denial she had felt so
absolutely certain would come, Harry Garlett remained silent
for what seemed a long time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he asked: “Who is the witness?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lucy Warren.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His face had turned a dull red, and, as if not knowing what
he was doing, his hands began nervously drumming on the
table before him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lucy Warren says the person you were with was a
stranger to her,” added Jean slowly, and she saw a look of
intense relief flash over his worn face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, my dear,” he said gently, “what is it you wish to
ask me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to know,” she said in a trembling voice, “whether
what she says is true.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Before he spoke she knew from the look on his face what
his answer, if he spoke the truth, must be. And her heart
was contracted, for the first time in her life, with a passion
of anguished jealousy.</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked at him fixedly, and something of what she was
feeling showed in her set face and wide-open eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last he said slowly, as if the words were indeed being
dragged out of him:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, it is quite true that I was there twice at night, and
with a woman. But the fact has nothing remotely to do with
my forthcoming trial for murder. So you must not ask me
who the woman was, Jean. It would be most unfair to drag
her into this terrible business of mine. I am sure you will
understand that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was looking at her straightly, but speaking with obvious
embarrassment and unease.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I was a fool to do a thing so likely to cause
poisonous gossip,” he went on. “But you will believe me
when I tell you, before God, that it was not my fault. There
are certain things concerning his past life that no man has
the right to reveal, even to his nearest and dearest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then more confidently he exclaimed, “Jean? You do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>understand—you do agree that it would be a shame to bring
some one who has nothing to do with the matter at all into
such a case as mine will be?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I agree to that,” she whispered. “And yet,
Harry, and yet——?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked at him so imploringly that for the first time
he leaned forward, in his eagerness, across the table which
separated them, and there came a warning cough from the
distant half-open door.</p>

<p class='c008'>He straightened himself quickly, and over his face she saw
flash a painful look of impotent anger.</p>

<p class='c008'>She said desperately, “You really feel you ought not to tell
who was with you that night in the wood—not even to me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not even to you! I’m not a quixotic fool, my darling.
If I thought it would make the slightest difference, of course
I would obtain permission from the person in question to
reveal her identity. But it would make no difference. It
would simply”—he stopped, then choosing his words carefully,
he concluded—“draw a hateful, vulgar red herring
across the path. I’m afraid that is the object of the people
who want me to give you the name of this lady who was
with me in the wood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As she made no answer to that, he looked at her searchingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have a right to ask you to believe that I did nothing of
which I am now ashamed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then there fell on them a long, long silence. Jean
felt overcome, dazed with miserable suspicions. It was as
if this man whom she still loved with so absorbing a passion
had suddenly revealed himself as being quite other than what
she had thought him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again there came the sound of a little cough, followed by
the rustling of a newspaper being slowly folded up.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean did not look round, but she could hear Colonel Brackbury
coming toward them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Bower, I’m afraid your time is up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at his prisoner. “Come round to the end of
the table, Garlett. I know Miss Bower would like to shake
hands with you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned away, deliberately, and then Harry Garlett took
the poor girl in his arms.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“I swear to you,” he whispered brokenly, “that you have
been my only love.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She raised her face, her lips, to his. “I do know that—God
bless you, my own darling!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then quickly they fell apart, for with a warning
“Hm! Hm!” the Governor, without turning round, exclaimed,
“Come along, Miss Bower.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Jean Bower walked away from the prison gate in a maze
of such misery as she had not believed a human being could
feel. For the first time in her life she realized what some
people learn very soon, and others never learn at all, even
if they live to be quite old people. This is that we do
not know, with any real knowledge, even those whom we
most passionately love and trust.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had felt so sure, so absolutely certain, that the story
of Harry Garlett’s meeting a woman in the wood was a malicious
lie! And now she knew that it was true, and that
there was some strange, painful mystery behind it.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had seen his pale face flush, and the look of embarrassment,
almost of shame, with which he had muttered:
“There are certain things about his past no man has the right
to reveal—even to his nearest and dearest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her mind hastily surveyed the young women known to her
who lived in and about Grendon. There were at least a
dozen with whom Harry Garlett was on easy terms of acquaintanceship.
But no young people had ever come openly
to the Thatched House. Mrs. Garlett did not care for girls,
and Agatha Cheale was well known to have no friends, with
the exception of Miss Prince.</p>

<p class='c008'>She walked on, threading her way as if blindly through
mean, and shabby streets, and, as she looked furtively to the
right and left, she knew that in every one of those little
houses there were people who were honestly convinced that
Harry Garlett had poisoned his wife for love of her. Small
wonder that she hurried on till at last she was in the open
country, with not a creature in sight. There, standing on a
field path, she stopped and burst into bitter tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>Crying did her good; it seemed to lift something of the
load weighing on her despondent heart. She dried her eyes,
vaguely telling herself that she would walk on till she felt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>too tired to go on—then, turning back, she would in time
reach Terriford village.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had been walking for close on an hour, her nerves
sensibly soothed by the fresh air, when all at once she saw
in front of her a farmhouse which she knew to be the home
of Lucy Warren.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sight of this place reminded her that her next painful
task must be to see Lucy Warren, to try to persuade the girl
to tell her that thing which it was so vital she should know,
and which yet she knew Harry Garlett hoped she would never
know. There are people—perhaps more women than men—who
delight in discovering that which those about them do not
wish them to know. But Jean Bower was the exact opposite.
She had an acute—some people might have said an absurd—sense
of honour. It would have seemed to her dishonest to
try and worm a secret, even a little secret, out of a child.</p>

<p class='c008'>She wondered uneasily how she could see Lucy Warren
without Miss Prince becoming aware she had done so. And
then fortune favoured her, for, as she took the turn which
would soon bring her to Terriford, she saw Lucy Warren
coming toward her.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two met in the middle of the field path, and Jean saw
an eager look leap to Lucy’s eyes. Lucy would have passed
any other young lady by with a curt nod, but this particular
young lady was not only always kindly, and even friendly,
in her manner, but was also the heroine of the most exciting
affair which had ever happened in the recollection of the
whole neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lucy! I am so glad to meet you——” and then Jean
held out her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>The other grasped it warmly. “You do look bad, miss!”
she exclaimed, real concern in her voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I feel very tired,” faltered Jean.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Won’t you come to the farm and rest a bit? There’s
only Mother there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d rather stay out here. Oh, Lucy, I know that you
have it in your power to help Mr. Garlett!”</p>

<p class='c008'>With the caution always shown by the more intelligent
of her class when face to face with the unknown, Lucy
Warren remained silent for a while, gazing, however, fixedly
into Jean Bower’s troubled face.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>“How might that be?” she asked at last.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The gentleman who is to defend Mr. Garlett says it’s
all-important to find out who was with him in the wood the
night you saw him there,” answered Jean in a trembling
voice. “I do implore you to tell me who it was, Lucy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I promised Mother I wouldn’t say nothing,” said Lucy
hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But your mother’s a good woman! She wouldn’t want
you to keep anything back that might save an innocent
man!” cried Jean wildly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I always said to Mother that I should have to say summat—sooner
or later.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean stared at the girl in breathless suspense.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The young lady as met Mr. Garlett in the wood,” said
Lucy at length, “was Miss Cheale.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Cheale? Are you sure of that, Lucy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was deep disappointment, instinctive relief, and a
touch of incredulity in the way in which Jean Bower repeated
the name of the young lady who for a year had been an inmate
of the Thatched House.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lucy moved a little closer to Jean Bower.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Us servants,” she said meaningly, “knows a lot more than
we’re meant to know. We all knew well enough that Miss
Cheale fair doted on Mr. Garlett—though he was always
trying not to see it. Why sometimes she’d be talking about
him in her sleep!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean Bower’s face, from pale became very red. Could
this be true? Or was it only an example of the kind of vulgar,
dangerous gossip of which she now knew village life to
be ever full?</p>

<p class='c008'>“What I’d like to ask Miss Cheale,” went on Lucy in an
excited voice, “and what ought to be asked her, is why she
told them lies about them strawberries?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lies?” repeated Jean in an oppressed tone. “I don’t
understand, Lucy. What lies did Miss Cheale tell?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She told your uncle, miss, that Mr. Garlett had given
the missus some strawberries that had been left for her by
Miss Prince. Well, that was just a lie! Them strawberries
were there on a chest of drawers in the corridor outside Mrs.
Garlett’s room in the early afternoon. I saw them there
myself. Then they just vanished off the chest of drawers—long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>before Mr. Garlett went into Mrs. Garlett’s room. I
can swear to that! I happens to have a special reason for
remembering it, for he said to me, ‘Lucy, will you please
go in and ask Mrs. Garlett if she can see me now?’ And I
says, says I, ‘No, sir, I don’t feel I can do that. The missis
is so angry with me about last night.’ So I went and got the
housemaid to go in—that’s why it remained so plain in my
mind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mean,” said Jean slowly, “that the strawberries
disappeared early in the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ay, that’s what I do mean,” said Lucy confidently.
“They were there, a good ’elping, not more, on one of them
small dishes belonging to the best dessert service.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who do you think gave them to Mrs. Garlett?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Lucy hesitated. “If it comes to that, the missus may have
got them for ’erself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought she never went into the passage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She came downstairs in the middle of the night spry
enough,” said the girl bitterly. “Besides, there’s nothing to
prove she got the poison with them strawberries—it’s only a
idea.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Jean was hardly listening, for her mind was full of
something very different.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are quite sure, Lucy, that it was Miss Cheale who
was in the wood with Mr. Garlett?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m more than sure. I saw ’er quite plain.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then there’s nothing more to be said. But I’m bitterly
disappointed,” said Jean sadly. “Somehow I had hoped
that whoever was in the wood with Mr. Garlett would—”
she did not quite know how to frame her meaning—“would,
well, provide a clue,” she ended.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lucy gave an odd glance at Jean. She felt very sorry for
Dr. Maclean’s niece.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Cheale was in the village the very day Mr. Garlett
was sent for trial,” she muttered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s impossible,” said Jean quickly, “she was ill in
London that day. Her evidence had to be read. She
couldn’t have been anywhere near Grendon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She was at our place—at the Thatched Cottage—early
that afternoon, and in an awful state, too! I heard her tell
Miss Prince that she <i>knew</i> Mr. Garlett was innocent.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>“You heard her say that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I did,” went on Lucy excitedly, “and don’t you forget
that it was Miss Cheale who always saw to Mrs. Garlett’s
food.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She had got it out now, that suspicion, that almost certainty,
that <i>hope</i>, that had long tormented her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But why,” asked Jean in an oppressed, bewildered tone,
“should Miss Cheale do such an awful thing?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She felt as if she was living through one of her terrible
nightmares.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Cheale,” said Lucy firmly, “thought that if she
could get Mrs. Garlett out of the way Mr. Garlett maybe
would marry her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t believe that, Lucy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anyway, she was terribly upset when she heard that you
and him was going to be married. She took on awful! I
heard what she said to Miss Prince, though they thought
as how I was out, I had come in, unbeknown to them, and
heard it all. Again and again she asked: ‘But is it true,
Mary, or just gossip?’ And Miss Prince, she kept on saying:
‘It is true, Agatha, only too true; I asked Mrs. Maclean,
and she admitted it.’ Then she says, ‘You must pull yourself
together, and call on your pride.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“D’you think it would be any good if I went in to Miss
Prince and asked her about Miss Cheale?” asked Jean in a
hesitating tone. “I mean, couldn’t she ask Miss Cheale what
she meant by saying that she knew that Mr. Garlett was
innocent?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A look of terror came into Lucy’s face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, miss, you won’t go and do that? It would get me
into terrible trouble! They’re such friends—she’d never say
a word against Miss Cheale, I know she wouldn’t! Why,
Miss Prince had a letter from her this very morning. That’s
why I’m here now. Miss Cheale wrote as how the woman
who keeps the place where she’s living in London can’t get
any help, and Miss Prince thought my sister might go—just
to oblige. Not much! But of course I couldn’t but say I’d
ask.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you give me Miss Cheale’s address?” asked Jean
in a stifled tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lucy began hunting in the narrow pocket of her ulster.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>“Not that you’ll get anything out of her! She’s an artful
one—she is!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She held out a crumpled piece of paper.</p>

<p class='c010'>Required from next Monday a respectable young woman to help.
Previous experience not essential. Wages, fifteen shillings a week
and all found. A comfortable home for the right person. Apply
Mrs. Lightfoot, 106, Coburg Square.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean Bower gazed down at the piece of paper now in her
hand for some time. Lucy was looking at her anxiously,
not liking to speak. Had she been wise to confide her great
secret, her frightful half-suspicion of the woman she hated,
to this young lady?</p>

<p class='c008'>At last Jean turned round.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lucy,” she said, “I’m going to trust you with a secret.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She spoke with a touch of solemnity which impressed the
girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m going to London to take this situation offered by”—she
looked again at the paper—“Mrs. Lightfoot.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You never are!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s my only chance of getting at Miss Cheale—of finding
out anything she may know. I don’t believe—I can’t believe—that
she had anything direct to do with the poisoning of
Mrs. Garlett. But she may know who did it. And now
I want to know if I may go to the Thatched Farm and write
out two telegrams, one to Mrs. Lightfoot, the other to a
friend of mine with whom I mean to spend to-night in London.
Would you take them for me to the post office?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That I will,” said Lucy.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they walked toward the farm together, it was as if
there sounded loudly in Jean’s ear the words Sir Harold
Anstey had uttered a couple of days ago: “Find the man
or woman who wrote those anonymous letters, and I promise
to save your lover’s life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean Bower now felt that she knew who had written those
letters.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>To Jean Bower it was an extraordinary stroke of
good fortune that to-day, for the first time for many
weeks, Dr. Maclean had persuaded his wife to accept an invitation
to luncheon. Thanks to that circumstance, the overwrought
girl was able to go back to Bonnie Doon, pack a
small bag containing the clothes she felt she must take with
her, write a short note to the kind folk to whom she stood in
so curious a relation, and, finally, enjoy a comforting talk
with Elsie MacTaggart.</p>

<p class='c008'>Somehow she now felt much more at ease with Elsie than
with either her uncle or aunt. Elsie was a whole-hearted
believer in Harry Garlett’s innocence, and a believer, too,
that he was sure to come out, as she put it, “all richt.” So
it was that at the very last moment before quitting Bonnie
Doon, she knew not for how long, Jean went into the kitchen
and took tight hold of Elsie’s work-worn hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m going away, Elsie,” she said, “in order to do something
that may help Mr. Garlett. I can’t say more, and if
I did they wouldn’t approve.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl continued, somewhat bitterly: “They’ve wanted
me to go away—they’ve longed for me to go away! Well,
now I <i>am</i> going away. I don’t know for how long. Here’s a
note in which I’ve given an address where I can be written to,
and of course I’ll let them know how I am, now and again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then as she heard the sound of a motor, the colour rushed
to her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They can’t be back yet,” she exclaimed in a dismayed tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Elsie smiled. “That’s the machine I just telephoned for
to Grendon. You were never going to walk to the station?
That would have been a foolish thing to do when maybe
you’ve some hard days in front of you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean took Elsie in her arms and hugged her. Then she
kissed her on both cheeks. “Good-bye, Elsie, I know that
<i>you</i> wish me well.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>“Ay, indeed, I’ll be doing that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And so, very quietly and without consulting anybody,
Jean Bower started on what was to be her great adventure.
It was such a comfort to feel that to Rachel North, at least,
she owed no explanations that she did not choose to give,
no duty of any sort, only gratitude for present kindness done.
It was also soothing to know that in London she would be
but one of millions of people intent on their own business
and not on hers. How different from a place where she
could hardly walk a few steps in the daylight without knowing
that even the village children were pointing her out to
each other!</p>

<p class='c008'>Cuthbert Street, Belgravia? The address sounded grand
to her country ears. But she knew that Rachel North in
far-away days had had a large circle of friends. Perhaps
it was some kindly survivor of those distant days who had
lent her a flat.</p>

<p class='c008'>On and on her taxi took her, through the dark streets, for
it was a late Saturday afternoon, and to Jean, looking out
of the windows, the long dreary streets seemed to grow shabbier
and shabbier.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last it turned into a thoroughfare which seemed interminable,
and of which the houses had that depressing, almost
terrible, look of having seen better days. The plaster was
peeling off the stucco walls, and here and there a window was
broken. There was a look of indescribable grime and dirt,
even on the pavements.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last the driver drew up opposite the very last house in
the street, one that overlooked a railway bridge.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I reckon it’s here,” he said looking round dubiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean told herself that there must be some mistake. The
house looked even more forlorn than did its neighbours,
and while she was glancing up at the gray crusted walls and
dirty windows, she heard the shriek of a train, and a moment
later there came a deafening roar.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, miss! This is 200, Cuthbert Street, right enough.
You give me my fare, and let me go off,” said the man rather
roughly. “I’m on another job in a few minutes, and this is
such an out-of-the-way part.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She paid him the big sum marked on the taximeter, took
her hold-all out of the cab, and with a slight sensation of fear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>as well as of deep surprise, she pressed the top one of the
four knobs which seemed to indicate that the house had
four occupiers.</p>

<p class='c008'>For what seemed a considerable while nothing happened;
and she pressed the second knob. Then, at last, a slatternly
looking woman opened the door and looked at her disagreeably.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re not wanting Mrs. Stratford?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Does Miss Rachel North live here? I’ve come to stay
with her,” said Jean, trembling a little.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As I’ve had the trouble of opening the door to you, you
can walk up. It’s the top floor. But you’d no business to
press my bell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry,” faltered Jean.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re not allowed to put our names outside the door.
And it’s a shame, that it is! I’m always coming up from my
basement just to open the door to some other lady’s visitors.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The woman turned round, leaving the front door open.
Jean shut it, and began slowly walking up the narrow dark
staircase. The house looked more than dirty; it looked
degraded.</p>

<p class='c008'>On and on she went, past frowsy-looking landings, till
she reached the top floor. There—a change indeed! A
piece of linoleum, scrupulously clean, was on the landing,
and, as she moved cautiously forward and knocked on the
door opposite the top of the staircase, a voice which had once
been very familiar, called out: “Come in!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned the handle, and saw before her a plainly furnished,
but pleasant little sitting room, and a girl who she
knew was Rachel North, rose from a low chair by the fire,
and came forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, Jean, I didn’t expect you for another hour! I
looked out the trains from Grendon. You must have come
by a slow one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did,” she answered rather breathlessly. “I was in such
a hurry to get away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know—to get busy,” said the other nodding her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was a reserved girl, and she did not kiss Jean Bower.
Instead, she took both her visitor’s hands, held them firmly,
and gazed into her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I won’t say much,” she exclaimed. “But I should like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>you to know that I do understand what you are feeling,
what you are going through, and I’ll do everything in my
power to help you. You know I’m engaged all day. I’m
so glad to-day happened to be a Saturday. But for that I
shouldn’t have got your telegram until after you’d arrived
in London!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then she drew Jean toward the bright little fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It isn’t a bad place,” she said critically, “once one’s up
here. The rest of the house is filthy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She took Jean’s hold-all. “Is this all you’ve brought?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said Jean, and there crept a tone of defiance into
her voice. “I think I may as well tell you at once why I’ve
come to London. I’m going to take a place on Monday as
general servant in a house where some one lives who, I believe
might help, if she chose to do so, to prove Harry’s
innocence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see,” said Rachel North slowly, “a bit of detective
work? Knowing how sensible you used to be, I suppose
that you’re acting under advice, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not altogether—but yes, I think I may say I’m acting
under advice. Perhaps I ought to go out now and get
clothes of the kind needed for that sort of work?”</p>

<p class='c008'>There came a troubled look into her face, and the older
girl felt touched, even a little amused.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you worry about clothes,” she exclaimed. “I
came very low down in the world at one time, and I’ve kept
the things I wore then. They’re awfully shabby, but they’re
quite clean. I don’t quite know why I kept them—it was a
sort of superstitious feeling. I felt that if I gave them away,
I might want them again. But now, well, my dear, you
know I’ve all sorts of queer ideas—now I think I was probably
intended to keep them that I might help you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>That this question should be settled so easily and so well
was more of a relief than perhaps Jean would have admitted
even to herself. She had given the matter of her outfit for
106, Coburg Square, a good deal of anxious thought on her
railway journey. She realized that the whole of her scheme
would fail if the woman to whose employment she was going
suspected that she was playing a part. She was too sensible
to suppose that she would be able to pass herself off as a
simple country girl of the working class, but she did hope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>that she would be able to make her employer believe that she
was out to earn an honest living, in however humble a
capacity.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, after they had enjoyed their cold supper, and
while Jean was lying back in an extraordinarily comfortable
couch which yet looked oddly big for the little room, her
friend exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps I’d better tell you now that you’re really on
what’s going to be your bed. I’ve thought it over, and
though I should have been delighted to give you my bedroom
and to have slept in here, I somehow felt that you’d far
rather sleep here and leave me my bedroom, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed, indeed, I would!” exclaimed Jean.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know,” the other nodded. “I once went to stay with
a friend, and I can’t tell you what I felt when I discovered
the next day that she had turned out of her room and slept
in the kitchen!”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Jean Bower awoke to find her friend smiling down at her.
There was a cup of tea in her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now then, you just drink this up. Then I’ll light the
fire, and after I’ve done that I’ll bring you those clothes I
told you about. I’ve just had a look at them. They’re old-fashioned
and ugly, but I don’t know that that really matters.
After all, your object is to look the part——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean sat up and drank the tea thirstily. Oh! how restful
to be here with this quiet, reserved young woman who, while
obviously sympathizing with her, was not in the least inquisitive.</p>

<p class='c008'>She caught Rachel North’s hand and pulled her down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know I’m grateful to you, without my saying so,”
she whispered. “I shall never forget how good you’ve
been!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve not been more good to you than two or three people
were to me, in my deep trouble. But I took my trouble in a
way I hope you will never do, Jean,” replied the other girl.
“I cut myself off from everybody after my father’s death.
I was wrong in that—I see it now. But I was so unhappy”—her
face altered, it became convulsed with feeling, and
she turned quickly away, busying herself in making and
lighting the fire.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Then she went off into her room and came back with a
curious little heap of garments in her arms. There was a
brown serge coat and skirt—the skirt unfashionably full,
while the coat was short and skimpy. Then there were two
clean, washed-out-looking flannel blouses.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This, I take it, is the sort of thing you want? But I
strongly advise you to buy some thick woollen underwear.
After all, the woman won’t see what you’re wearing underneath
your coat and skirt.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How clever you are, Rachel. I should never have
thought of that,” said Jean admiringly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t want to go and fall ill the first day you’re
there. Especially as you’ll have need of an alert mind.
I’m afraid you’ll have very nasty food.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t mind that,” said Jean quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, don’t you? Well, you wait a bit. It’s easy to talk
like that! I’ve come to think that nice food is one of the
most important things in the world. If I were you I should
take some malted milk, or cod liver oil and malt, in your
trunk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Trunk?” queried Jean doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A good, big, deep suitcase rather than a wooden box.
The woman who’s going to employ you won’t think your
bringing such a thing queer at all. In fact, I think she’d
think it odd if you came with practically nothing but a
hold-all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose that’s true,” said Jean. “All right—I put
myself in your hands. You shall tell me what to do!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Rachel North smiled. She was one of those women who
love power, and, given the chance, exercise it wisely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you don’t mind getting up a bit early on Monday
morning there’s a place close by here, a great big cheap store,
where all the working girls go. We’ll get some kind of suitcase
there, and we’ll buy two sets of their best warm underclothing.
If your employer should see them by any chance
you can say they were given you by a kind lady!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then they both burst into peals of girlish laughter.
Jean had not laughed so heartily as that for many a long
day.</p>

<p class='c008'>“By the way, have you chosen a good name to call yourself
by?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>“I’m going as ‘Elizabeth Chart,’ my mother’s maiden
name,” and the laughter died out of her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly Rachel said, “I must go out and get my Sunday
papers. When one is leading a lonely life one does depend
tremendously on reading, and, I’m not ashamed to say it, on
newspaper reading. Papers are my only luxury, and on
Sundays I have a regular debauch!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean was staring into the fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose you’ve read everything that’s been printed
about, about”—and then she said rather defiantly—“about
Harry and me? I know there must have been horrid things,
for Uncle Jock made me promise not to look at the papers—not
even at the paper they take in at Bonnie Doon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said Rachel North reluctantly, “I have seen a good
deal about you, Jean. But everything so far about you has
been kind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Jean jumped up from her chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hate that!” she exclaimed. “I’d far rather they said
horrible things—as I know they do about Harry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They have to be careful,” said Rachel North in a detached
tone. “No paper is allowed to prejudge a case.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yet they do prejudge it!” exclaimed Jean Brower excitedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, yes, in a sense I’m afraid they do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When Rachel North came back she handed the bundle of
papers to Jean, and began bustling in and out of her tiny
kitchen getting dinner ready—a delicate little bit of undercut
which was to be served French fashion with fried potatoes
and some salad.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean began looking at one of the papers listlessly. Then
all at once she realized that in the middle of the big sheet
was a square space, and within it, running ribbon-wise across
the top ran:</p>

<p class='c010'>THE TERRIFORD MYSTERY</p>

<p class='c010'>AN EXCITING DEVELOPMENT</p>

<p class='c010'>Exclusive to <cite>The Sunday Critic</cite></p>

<p class='c010'><cite>The Sunday Critic</cite> learns on absolutely reliable authority that
the prosecution believe that they are at last on the track of the one
missing link in The Terriford Mystery.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>That Mrs. Emily Garlett died from a large dose of white arsenic
is certain, but till two days ago there was no clue as to where the
murderer, the murderess, or the murderers, had obtained the poison.
This doubt, so we are credibly informed, is on the point of being
solved. The discovery has not changed the present situation, and no
further arrests are contemplated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean read the paragraph again and again. Then she
called out, “Rachel, come here, and tell me what this
means?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Rachel North hurried into the room. She knelt down by
the girl’s side and read the paragraph.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It means,” she said in a quiet, matter-of-fact voice, “that
if this paper is to be believed the prosecution have found
where the arsenic was purchased. The implication is that it
was purchased by Mr. Garlett; hence those words, ‘The situation
is unchanged. No further arrests are contemplated.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then something happened which, though it terrified
Rachel North, gave a few moments of merciful oblivion to
Jean Bower. The supple, rounded figure, full of the
strength of living life, suddenly sagged. She would have
fallen on the floor had not the other caught hold of her. But
Rachel North’s hospital training stood her in good stead.
She laid the unconscious form flat on the floor, and rushing
off to her bedroom, came back with some sal-volatile which
she forced through Jean’s lips. And at last, with a low
moan the girl regained consciousness.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a few moments she struggled up on to her knees.
Then she looked round her, dazed, forgetting where she was,
and what had happened. But all too soon everything rushed
back into her mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>Painfully she lifted herself up again on to the chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to read that paragraph again,” she said in a
trembling voice. “I want to understand exactly what it
means.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think you will be able to do that, dear. It’s put
in that odd, uncertain way on purpose; but honestly, Jean, I
don’t think you need attach much importance to it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, for the first time since her arrival, Jean Bower
had a heart-to-heart talk with Rachel North over the whole
mysterious story. They discussed every alternative possibility,
and, as so often happens, Jean began to feel happier,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>more self-controlled, as a result of that long talk. One thing
which greatly comforted her was that after hearing all she
had to say Rachel North suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think I was wrong as to what I said to you—I mean
as to the prosecution having found the place where Mr.
Garlett may have purchased arsenic. What I think has happened
is that they have found something in the Thatched
House from which arsenic can be extracted. Now apparently
arsenic can be extracted from almost anything! That
being so, it would be strange indeed if nothing of the sort
had been found.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s true,” said Jean, “and yet”—her face clouded
over—“and yet, Rachel, they’ve left no stone unturned—one
might almost say that literally—to find arsenic in the
Thatched House.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Rachel North took her friend’s hand. “You will want
all your wits about you during this experiment that you are
going to try. If you allow yourself to be unnerved by what
has been published by that paper then I’m afraid you’ll
injure your chance of success. From all you tell me, I agree
with you that that woman Agatha Cheale knows far more
than she has chosen to tell. Her behaviour after Mr. Garlett
was committed for trial—I mean her behaviour in coming
down to see Miss Prince—is to my mind almost an
indication that she knows something she is unwilling to
reveal. Now I wonder—perhaps you’ll be shocked at what
I’m going to say, Jean—I wonder if Miss Cheale—well, to
put it plainly, was fond of Mr. Garlett?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean looked at Rachel.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” she said slowly, “I’m afraid Miss Cheale did care
for Harry, and it’s because I can’t help suspecting that she
had something to do with the writing of those anonymous
letters that I’m going to the house where she is living. She’s
only seen me twice in her life. I feel sure she won’t know
me again, and, as I’ve already told you, Sir Harold Anstey
thinks it is all-important that I should find out who wrote
those letters.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I agree,” said Rachel quickly. “Whoever wrote those
letters was either instigated by the most fiendish spite, and
simply wanted to make Mr. Garlett miserable for nothing,
or else he or she must have known that if an exhumation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>should take place arsenic would certainly be found in Mrs.
Garlett’s body.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think Agatha Cheale wrote those letters to make Harry
wretched—to punish him for not having loved her. If I
thought she knew Mrs. Garlett was poisoned, then I should
regard her as——” she broke off in what she was going to
say, and the other exclaimed, “A—murderess? Yes, that’s
the only logical conclusion!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>“Can you tell me the shortest way to Coburg Square?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s round by the Foundling Hospital. I’m going
that way myself, so you’d best come along with me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The man peered through the dark fog-laden air into the
young pale face looking up at him from under the brim of a
singularly unbecoming plain brown straw hat. He was an
old bachelor who never, if he could help it, spoke to a woman,
but he had been mollified by the sweetness of her voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Foundling Hospital? It was a comfort to her in her
present forlorn condition to think of all that that great house
of human pity and sympathy had done for innumerable
deserted and friendless orphans.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the first time in her life she was assailed by that most
unnerving of companions, “Little Devil Doubt.” What she
was about to do was surely a terrible risk? If she failed,
as she might well fail, and her desperate enterprise were to
become known, would she not be universally condemned?
Might it not even get into the papers? Harry Garlett’s
betrothed taking a place as a servant for his sake! She
could almost picture the terrible headlines! She felt so
nervous, so excited, that when the deep voice of her conductor
suddenly interrupted her anxious self-questioning, she
stumbled, and would have fallen had not he put out his
hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you just turn down to the left here,” said the man,
“and then turn sharp to the right, the house you want will
be within three or four of the corner of the square.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In response to her word of thanks, he took off his hat and
went his way. Jean then walked on slowly, and now and
again she stopped. This was her last chance to change her
mind, to give up what she well knew most of the people
who had known and respected her in her short life would
consider a crazy adventure.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>When she came to the end of the long street which led into
the square she pressed her cold hand across her face. Her
eyes were smarting, partly with the fog, partly from the tears
she had shed in the night. She felt unutterably sad and
discouraged, and yet deep in her heart she longed to engage
in what she believed would be a duel between herself and that
strange woman, Agatha Cheale.</p>

<p class='c008'>If Lucy Warren’s tale were true, Agatha Cheale was the
one person in the world who had had a vital reason for desiring
Mrs. Garlett’s death.</p>

<p class='c008'>Throwing off “Little Devil Doubt,” Jean decided to go on.
She crossed over to the corner house of the square. To her
left she could dimly discern the railings of the narrow garden
facing the dark houses to her right.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no one in sight, and she felt strangely eerie
walking along the wide uneven pavement trying to make out
the number on each door. Even the street lamps seemed to
gleam more dimly here than elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c008'>She found 109. Then the gloomy-looking unlit house
with the portico must be 106.</p>

<p class='c008'>Blindly she groped for a bell, and at last she felt a row of
knobs. As her fingers slid over them uncertainly there came
over her a sudden feeling of acute fear. What if Agatha
Cheale should open the door and recognize her?</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she told herself that her fear was absurd. She had
only met Miss Cheale twice. The first time in the cricket
pavilion where Mrs. Garlett’s housekeeper had been absorbed
in looking after the numerous guests and their entertainment.
Then, again, for a few moments on the morning
when Miss Cheale, livid with anger, was giving notice to
Lucy Warren; and on that day, she, Jean Bower, had been
wearing a large hat which completely shadowed her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, with intense relief, she reminded herself that of
course her way of entrance should be by the back door.
Creeping out from under the dark portico, she felt along the
iron railings. Yes, here was the area gate! And luckily it
was unlatched. She pushed it open and found that it led
to a steep stone staircase. Down she went, feeling her way
from one worn step to the next till she reached the bottom.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was now in a small pit-like yard, and to her right,
from behind what was evidently the kitchen window of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>cavernous old house, there shone a bright light. As she
could see no door, she knocked, at last, timidly on the window.
A moment later a narrow door was opened wide and
she walked through into a stone passage lighted by a gas-jet,
while a not unkindly voice exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re Elizabeth Chart, I take it? Didn’t think you’d
come for another hour, my dear. Come into my kitchen,
do! And I’ll have some tea ready for you in a jiffy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The speaker was a gray-haired, red-faced woman, immensely
stout, and dressed in an old-fashioned alpaca dress.
She wore a Paisley shawl neatly pinned across her vast
breast with a cameo brooch.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Elizabeth’s a mouthful—so if you don’t mind I’ll call
you Bet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll like that,” faltered the girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now then, Bet, you go right into my kitchen and get
warm. ’Twill be a great relief to me, I reckon, having a
country girl after them London sluts. I was that pleased
when I got the telegram saying you was coming this afternoon
that I could ’a’ danced!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a homely-looking kitchen with a big red fire in the
old-fashioned, wasteful grate. The bright light the girl had
seen from outside came from a chandelier hanging in the
middle of the ceiling. Under the light the two faced one
another—Mrs. Lightfoot, the housekeeper, and Bet Chart,
the new servant. With thankfulness Bet noticed that her
employer had a shrewd, good-humoured face, and, in spite
of her huge girth, a brisk, cheerful way of moving about.</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Tain’t no good taking you upstairs yet. You can just
pop your things off in my room. This way, please!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She led the way into what had evidently once been the
butler’s pantry in the stately old house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d ’a’ liked to ’ave ’ad you near me, my dear, but I
wouldn’t keep a dog’s kennel in any of the other rooms in
this ’ere basement; they’re that damp and dark.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A fire was burning in the room they were now in, and by
its light Jean saw a big bed and some nice old-fashioned
furniture.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This room and next door to it is my ’ome,” said Mrs.
Lightfoot with pride. “You’ll sleep under the roof. I goes
up and down as little as I can, for though I used to live up to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>my husband’s name I can’t do with stairs! Still I can move
about quick, as you’ll soon see. Like to wash your ’ands?
You can do so in my basin as a treat to-day, but henceforth
you’ll ’ave to wash ’em at the sink.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A few moments later Jean came back into the kitchen.
She felt very strange and odd in her full brown skirt, her
flannel blouse, and the neat, Quaker-like little white muslin
cap she and Rachel North had bought that morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right!” exclaimed Mrs. Lightfoot, “not ashamed
to wear a cap as was our last fine lady? A little treasure
you’re setting out to be. The last ’ussy I ’ad ’ere, she’s got
a job as a demonstrator—putting rouge on her lips and
whitening her face. I reckon that’ll suit her ladyship for
the present, till she moves on to—I won’t demean myself by
saying where.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She had set out bread, butter, and jam on the kitchen
table. Then, apparently afraid lest her praise should make
her new help uppish, she observed critically:</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t look over-strong for a country girl. Mind
you, there’s stairs ’ere—stairs, stairs, stairs all the time!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m very strong,” said Jean in a low voice, “it’s only that
I’m tired to-day. You see I’ve come a long way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ay, that’s true—and not over familiar with London, I
daresay.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know London at all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean looked straight into the other’s fat face. She was
glad to be able to say something which was absolutely true.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There now, fancy that! You surprise me—seein’ that
I can see you’ve ’ad some edication. I’m a Londoner born
and bred—proud of it, too. It’s unlucky you and me can’t
go out together. I’d take you to see the sights! But you’ll
be able to go ’ere and there on your afternoon off. A young
girl like you won’t be long before she gets a friend to walk
out with.”</p>

<p class='c008'>To that Jean made no answer. Instead she sat down
and poured herself out a cup of tea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As you come from Terriford I expect you’re quite familiar-like
with all the parties concerned with this ’ere Garlett
murder—The Thatched ’Ouse Mystery some calls it?
Ever seen my top floor—Miss Cheale? She’s in it, of
course!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>“I don’t think I’ve ever seen her,” faltered Jean.</p>

<p class='c008'>She bent her face down to her plate. “I wasn’t in Terriford
long.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll give you a peep at Miss Cheale some time or other,”
said Mrs. Lightfoot kindly. “But she’s the one of my
lodgers you won’t ’ave much to do with. I do the waitin’ on
’er myself. She simply can’t abear strangers! But you’ll
’ave to help do ’er room, mind you. ‘What the hear don’t
’ear, the ’eart don’t grieve at.’ She thinks I never lets any
one into her room. But there she’s mistaken. I can’t do
all the work, and it’s lucky for me that my front ground
floor’s been hempty a while, though now you’ve come, my
dear, I don’t mind ’ow soon it fills up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean’s hands were shaking. How stupid, how idiotic of
her, not to have realized that Agatha Cheale’s connection
with the Thatched House would be known to Mrs. Lightfoot!</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’s takin’ on awful about that case,” went on the
housekeeper. “She left ’ere over a year ago to go to that
very Mrs. Garlett as lady-’ousekeeper. I says to ’er then,
‘You’re a fool to give up your hindependence, Miss Cheale,
my dear!’ But she would do it. And see where it’s landed
’er!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Has Miss Cheale ever told you how she thinks Mrs.
Garlett was poisoned?” asked Jean.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I simply wouldn’t dare ask ’er. I ’ave tried once or twice
to sort of lead on to it delicately—but she can’t bear the
littlest question about it. Oh, she’s a fly one! It wasn’t
till I seed her name in the paper that she let on she’d anything
to do with it. Since then—well, it stands to reason she’s ’ad
to say just a bit about it to me now and again. What’s upset
her so as been those dratted lawyers—first one side, then the
other, coming and worrying ’er somethin’ hawful! That’s
why she’s ’ad to speak to me about it so that I should prevent
’em coming up to her. And I ’ave prevented ’em!” exclaimed
Mrs. Lightfoot.</p>

<p class='c008'>Unconsciously she put her arms akimbo and assumed a
fighting attitude.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Many a fine bold lie ’ave I told in ’er good cause! Be
spot truthful when you’re young, but as time goes on, allow
yourself a little law. That’s a motter for you, Bet Chart,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>and a good one, too. After all, Miss Cheale can’t say what
she don’t know—can she?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No one knows anything,” said Jean at last. “It’s a terrible,
terrible mystery,” and she pushed her plate away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now you just go on eating, Bet. It’s real butter; no
cheap margarine for me! Never would ’ave it in my ’ouse
for all I’ve come down in the world, as the saying is. During
the war plain honest dripping as I got off a chef I know:
since then the best butter. You’ll find I live up to what I
said, ‘a comfortable ’ome for a suitable person.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>So Jean forced herself to eat a bit more of Mrs. Lightfoot’s
excellent bread and butter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In a way ’tis a mystery,” went on her employer, “though
in another way ’tis no mystery at hall! Young man marries
old woman for ’er money. Gets fair sick of ’er. Meets a
pretty young girl. Takes a fancy to <i>’er</i> and does away with
the old ’un. So far all clear. As I says to Miss Cheale early
this very morning: ‘Don’t you take on so, miss. It’s ’appened
plenty of times before and it’ll ’appen plenty times
again—before the judgment day! Anyway,’ I says, ‘it’ll
be all the same a ’undred years hence.’ But between you
and me, Bet Chart, I’ve another idea.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There are some people who think that perhaps Mrs.
Garlett poisoned herself,” said Jean.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had given up the pretence of eating and was now
looking fixedly into Mrs. Lightfoot’s red face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, that I never will believe! Not if the King himself
come out of Buckingham Palace and commanded me so to
do! I’ve read pretty well heverything that’s been written
about this ’ere so-called mystery. I makes a special study
of murders. Always ’ave done so, though it turns me faint
to drown a new-born kitten in warm water. I’ve been found
right many a time, and that afore the judge and jury ’ave
made up their minds!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And what d’you think now?” asked Jean eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“More than once I’ve hasked myself whether that forward
hussy, Jean Bower, did it? She ’ad every reason to want
the poor soul out of the way, but it don’t look at present as
if she’d hever ’ad the chance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” said Bet Chart quietly, “Jean Bower never even
saw Mrs. Garlett.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>“That, beggin’ your pardon, Bet, may be a tale! I don’t
see ’ow <i>you</i> could know, anyway. It would ’a’ been strange
if they’d never met, living in the same place, and both being
gentry. And she the doctor’s niece! What’s she like? I
suppose you’ve seen ’er?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said Jean. “I’ve seen her. She’s just ordinary—like
everybody else.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’re generally the worst,” said Mrs. Lightfoot. “Very
much the worst—if you’ll believe me. I’ve given a lot o’
study to that girl. There’s some one a protectin’ ’er, not a
doubt of it! Else why wasn’t she called when that man
’Enry Garlett was committed for his trial? She ought to ’a’
been! They did their level best to try and compel my poor
top floor to go to Grendon town. She ’ad to ’ave a doctor,
and ’e ’ad to give ’er a certificate. And even that wasn’t
enough! We ’ad a lawyer ’ere—a man from the Crown, he
called ’isself—but I don’t believe for one minute the King
knew the way ’e went on. ’Ow ’e worried that poor young
woman! She made me stay in the room all the time—and a
good thing, too. There ’e was, close up to ’er bed, with a big
book and a fountain pen—why it wasn’t decent. She wouldn’t
eat any supper after that. She cried and cried, and I was
fair tormented about ’er! Yet they left that Bower girl—that
forward sly ’ussy—habsolutely alone. What d’you say
to that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They didn’t leave her absolutely alone,” said Jean slowly.
“Some one came from the Crown to see her and cross-examine
her, too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m glad of that,” said Mrs. Lightfoot, “very glad, indeed!
That’s the best word I’ve ’eard you say, Bet Chart,
about the whole business. I’m intending to get in at that
trial even if I’m crushed to death doing so! It’ll take the
place of my summer outing. I don’t often go in for that
sort o’ treat, but I did see The Brides in the Bath man. I
saw him black-capped.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How dreadful!” whispered the help, and she turned
even whiter than she had been before.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d a friend at the Old Bailey, one of the judge’s clerks—my
’usband’s uncle was Mr. Justice Barnaby’s clerk—and
that gives me a sort o’ connection with the law. So they’re
very kind to me when I goes down to the Old Bailey, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>could get in much oftener than I does if I could leave the
’ouse. Still, as I ’opes and believes you’ll be ’ere when ’Enry
Garlett’s trial takes place, I’ll just give myself the treat of
seeing my poor Miss Cheale in the witness-box.” She waited
a moment to take breath, then added significantly: “You
just look over there!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean turned round quickly to see a great pile of newspapers
lying in a corner of the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Cheale takes in five newspapers a day, if you’ll
believe me—just with the idea of seeing something new about
that hawful affair. If it had been war-time I could ’ave
made my fortune out of them old papers, but now the dustman
wants to be paid for carrying them away! But there!
I do get something out of it, for o’ course I reads ’em all—when
I ’ave the time, that is! As for Miss Cheale, she just
pores over them, and hevery one of the Sunday papers she
takes in too. I ’aven’t ’ad time yet to look over yesterday’s.
But I will this evenin’, and it’ll be a treat for you too, Bet.
There was something in one of them papers as greatly upset
Miss Cheale. She wouldn’t say nought about it—but I
knew! It’s never out of her mind, that it isn’t. She even
talks about it in her sleep. My last girl used to ’ear her,
and it fair give ’er the creeps.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hadn’t I better begin washing up?” asked Jean timidly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, yes, I reckon you ’ad. All the people in this ’ouse
goes out to work for their daily bread. Leastways, all but
one does. I won’t ’ave no drones if I can ’elp it. No
drones and no—you can guess what sort I mean for all you’re
an hinnocent young thing. I could ’ave made a lot of money,
retired too, and lived in peace and plenty, if I ’adn’t been
a respectable woman, but there! I can’t help it—I just
ham.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean made no reply to that obviously truthful statement.
Instead, she carried the tea-things she had used one after
the other to the broad sink.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hullo,” called out Mrs. Lightfoot suddenly, “ever ’eard
of a tray?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl turned round surprised.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How stupid of me,” she exclaimed. And then suddenly
her heart almost stopped beating, for Mrs. Lightfoot walked
straight up to her and said, “You’ve never been hout before?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>You’re not the plain country lass I took you for. What
har you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m the daughter of a man of business, Mrs. Lightfoot.
My father failed before he died. I never was taught to do
anything, though I did what I could in a hospital during the
war. When I heard of your situation last week I was on
my beam ends.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Lightfoot looked relieved.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guessed you were something just not quite common,”
she admitted cautiously. “The way you put your cup to your
lips, in a sort of finicky way, henlightened me. I expect you
was sent to a genteel school.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose I was,” said the other almost in a whisper.
“But I don’t mind hard work. You’ll see I don’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then suddenly she began to cry. “I—I’ve been so
unhappy,” she gasped, “since my father died.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There, there! You’ll be ’appy ’ere. Don’t you worry,
and don’t you go and think, as many a silly young girl
supposes nowadays, that all the good chaps were killed in
the war. If there’s only one left, you’ll find him right
enough! And if not, I’ll find ’im for you. There’s some
good elderly gents about too, just now. Better be an old
man’s darling than a young man’s slave. Hany old barndoor
can keep out the draught! But no carryings on with
the lodgers, mind! But there, I won’t insult you, Bet, my
dear, by supposing you capable of doing such a thing. Likewise,
you won’t ’ave a chance, for I does most of the waiting
on the gentlemen myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then came three knocks on the floor above the kitchen
ceiling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that?” exclaimed the new “help.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My hinvalid—a mystery <i>’e</i> is—Mr. Gee by name—though
not ’is real one, between you and me and the lamp-post.
But you’ll have nothing to do with ’im.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She went off upstairs: then came back, and said suddenly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you cook at all, my dear, or shall I ’ave to teach you
that—as well as the use of a tray?”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Mrs. Lightfoot spoke very good-humouredly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can cook simple things,” said Jean, “and I know some
nice Scotch breakfast dishes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t want you to go a-spoiling my lodgers! Plain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>and good—that’s my motter. Eggs and bacon week-days,
an’ midget sausages on Sunday for a treat. My gentlemen
pays for ‘bed and breakfast,’ and though it’s near double
what it was afore the war, yet it needs a good bit more
contriving than it did then, I can tell you. As to Miss
Cheale, well, she goes on another plan. I just buys what
she wants. She makes a tidy bit of money out of them
Russians she works for. Besides, as you maybe ’ave ’eard,
she was left a little fortune by that poor poisoned soul!”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>At six-thirty there came the sound of the big front door
opening. Then it was shut slowly, carefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s Mr. Robins,” remarked Mrs. Lightfoot; “’e’s a
very careful gentleman. Halways the first to come in, for
the reason he works near ’ere at the British Museum. A
proper, quiet sort o’ man, though they do say ’e was a regular
devil in the war! But there! ’E’s settled down peaceful
nicely now. ’E’s got my big front drawing room, and
beautiful ’e’s made it with some things ’is ma left ’im when
she died.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Something like a quarter of an hour went by, and then
again there came the sound of the front door opening. This
time it was banged to.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Goodbody,” said the housekeeper. “A merry, cheerful
little gentleman, as lives up to ’is name. Going to be
married, so we sha’n’t keep ’im long. I’ll miss ’im when
’e goes—not that I exactly envy ’is missis, mind you, but
still it’s nice to be always greeted with a laugh and a joke.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s Miss Cheale,” exclaimed Mrs. Lightfoot, as a
church clock near by struck seven. “Sometimes she works
even later than this. ’Er arrival is the signal for me to
get busy. I got ’er a nice chop to-day. She going to ’ave
fried potatoes with it—fried potatoes and brussels sprouts—likewise
a meringue. Not one of those bought meringues—all
glue and a lick of cream. But a meringue I’ve got to
fill chock-full of whipped cream. Miss Cheale knows what
she likes, and, unlike some folks, she’s willing to pay for it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As she spoke she got up, and began moving about, and
when Jean offered to help her she shook her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let be, let be,” she exclaimed; “’nother night I may let
you try your ’and at Miss Cheale’s supper, but to-night I’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>better do it, for I knows what she likes, and exactly ’ow
she likes it. But I’ll tell you what I will let you do! I’ll
let you carry up the tray as far as the landing. We must
take the risk of ’er seeing you—morbid, ain’t it, ’er dislike
of seeing people?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Twenty minutes later Jean took the heavily loaded tray
and started going up the kitchen stairs. In front of her,
treading more and more slowly, more and more wheezily,
walked the housekeeper. The gas-light in the hall showed
the fine tessellated black and white pavement and the two
mahogany doors. As they walked past the door giving into
a back room on the ground floor Jean heard a choking cough.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There ’e is, pore gentleman, coughing ’is life away,”
whispered Mrs. Lightfoot compassionately. “It’ll be a mercy
for me, as well as for ’im and another I could name, when
’e’s gone. But that sort lingers on and on—never knowing
they’re going either.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They went on, up the first flight, and though there was
another gas-jet halfway up, the house seemed wrapped in
gloom. It was, however, a magnificent remnant of London’s
eighteenth-century architecture; the banisters of the wide
staircase were of wrought iron, and it did not require much
imagination to see the beaux and the belles of a hundred
and fifty years ago walking down the wide, low steps hand
in hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they reached the drawing-room floor, the door of
the back drawing room opened, and a cheerful chubby-looking
young man’s face looked out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hullo! Mrs. Heavyfoot? Got a lady-in-waiting at last,
eh?” And then the speaker looked hard at the girl carrying
the tray. “Here’s a pretty miss! D’you know who you remind
me of, pretty miss?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, none of your nonsense!” said Mrs. Lightfoot
sharply, “you an engaged gentleman too! Fie! Mr. Goodbody.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You remind me,” went on Mr. Goodbody, taking no
notice of his landlady, “of a beauteous young female called
Pamela—‘Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded.’ But I fear me
you’ll have none of the wondrous adventures which befell
Pamela—not while you’re under the eagle eye of your present
chaperon!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Jean made no answer to these facetious remarks, but she
looked at him so coldly that the young man felt, as he expressed
it to himself, somewhat withered. Quietly he withdrew
into his own quarters and shut the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“’E means no ’arm,” panted Mrs. Lightfoot tolerantly,
“’e’s only out for a bit of fun. And yet, would you believe
it? ’Is young lady, well, she ’ardly smiles! I suppose ’e’s
tired her with ’is fun, that’s what ’e’s done.”</p>

<p class='c008'>On and on they went, and then the housekeeper suddenly
said: “’Ush!” In a low whisper she added: “I sees that
’er door is open. You just give me that tray, and then,
when I’ve fixed ’er up comfortable, you can creep up be’ind
me, and I’ll show you where you’re to sleep. Then I won’t
’ave to come up again to show you—see?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And there on the dark staircase the girl waited—it seemed
to her for a long time, while murmurs of conversation came
from behind the now shut door of Miss Cheale’s sitting room.
She felt extraordinarily strung up and excited at the
thought that there, within a few feet of her, was the woman
who claimed to have the key to the mystery of Mrs. Garlett’s
death.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last Mrs. Lightfoot came out of the brightly lit room,
and beckoned to her help; and Jean, hurrying on to the landing,
saw a narrow ladder-like staircase.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No need for me to go up. You can’t make no mistake,
Bet, for only one o’ the two garrets up there ’as any furniture
in it. I don’t say you’ll find it very comfortable, but
’tain’t as if ’twas terrible cold just now. You can move
about too, for all you’re just over Miss Cheale’s bedroom.
They don’t build ’ouses like this nowadays. She’s in a rare
nervy state to-night. She’s frightened of a feller that’s
been ’anging about ’ere a lot—name of Kentworthy. ’E’s
getting up this case for ’Enry Garlett. But ’e don’t get
much change out of me—though before I knew what ’e was
up to, we became quite friendly-like. Oh, ’e’s an artful one!
But ’e won’t get over Jemima Lightfoot—and I told ’im
so flat! Only once did ’e force ’is way into this ’ouse and
that was when I wasn’t in it.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>With a loud cry of “What is it? What’s the matter?”
Jean, in the pitch darkness, sat up in her narrow
pallet bed, and listened.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a moment or two she didn’t know where she was, and
fear clutched at her heart. And then, though memory soon
came back, it was accompanied by icy waves of terror, and
it was with a trembling hand that she lit a candle.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was now quite still and quiet up there under the roof
of the huge old house. Then, all at once, the sounds that
had awakened her began again. The sound of a loud, discordant
voice—or was it two voices?—that seemed terrifyingly
near.</p>

<p class='c008'>Clasping her hands together nervously, Jean listened intently.
It was a high-pitched voice—only one voice after
all—uttering quick, eager, argumentative words, of which
she could not catch the sense.</p>

<p class='c008'>The candle was burning more brightly now, and she looked
timorously round her. Mrs. Lightfoot, with all her kind,
hearty good-nature, had never bethought herself of making
the bedroom of her help even a little comfortable. It was
a large garret, and the ceiling was so low that it gave its
occupant a feeling of being pressed down upon. The flooring
boards, which were not over-clean, were bare, though by the
pallet bed lay a dingy-looking string mat. A tub and minute
iron washing-stand were in a corner, and a rickety yellow-painted
chest of drawers stood far away, under the dormer
window, and on it was the cheapest form of toilet-glass
made. Jean had laughed when she had looked at herself in
it, for so distorted a view of her face had never been presented
to her gaze before. But now, sitting up in bed, the
thought of that distorting looking-glass gave her a feeling of
horror and affright.</p>

<p class='c008'>The one chair in the room was dirty and very shaky.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>On it there now stood her light, cheap, almost empty, suitcase.
There were three hooks screwed into the door, but
she had put her clothes on the bed, for in spite of Mrs.
Lightfoot’s remark, she had felt very cold....</p>

<p class='c008'>All at once she realized that the voice she heard was
Miss Cheale’s voice. Leaping out of bed, she caught up her
outdoor jacket and put it on; then, after listening intently,
she opened her door, leaving the candle alight.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a moment the darkness baffled her. Then she felt
along the wall, and at last found the cord which ran down
along the side of the dangerous, ladder-like stairs. Putting
one bare foot slowly, cautiously, before the other, down she
went, very, very slowly, terrified lest she should make the
smallest sound.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last her feet rested on the landing out of which opened
Miss Cheale’s sitting room and bedroom, and, as she stood
there, the voice suddenly stopped.</p>

<p class='c008'>Was it possible that Agatha Cheale had heard the stuffless
sounds which she had made while treading with her bare feet
down the wooden stairs?</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, to her mingled fright and relief, she heard the
voice begin again, speaking now loudly, now almost in a
whisper.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tip-toeing across the lobby, she crouched down outside
the closed bedroom door, and there at last she heard quite
clearly the words that seemed tumbling out one after another,
as if the lips that uttered them could not get them out
quickly enough.</p>

<p class='c008'>And yet those words, those sentences, were punctuated
with strange pauses. It was as if the speaker were taking
part in an eager, sometimes embittered, argument with an
unseen opponent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am speaking up. I have nothing to conceal....
A tall dark man.... I think I should.... It is
a broad corridor.... No, I did not think of it, I
thought him a workman.... I did not know I was
free to speak sooner.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The staccato sentences were uttered with extraordinary
energy. Then with a complete change of voice came the
quiet words:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I always liked Mrs. Garlett very much.... Yes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>she was invariably most kind to me. Of course Mr. Garlett
was also kind and considerate, but I saw very little of him....
I was naturally with Mrs. Garlett very much more....
Undoubtedly&#160;... as long, that is, as Mr. and
Mrs. Garlett wished me to stay. Three hundred pounds is
not an exceptional salary.... No communication with
Mr. Garlett.... Once, just after the war.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, with sudden passion, “You have no right to say
that.” There came an appeal in the voice. “My lord, am
I compelled to answer that question?... They were
forced strawberries given by a lady who will, if necessary,
confirm what I say&#160;... Miss Prince, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then at last, as if telling a story, and in a much more
composed, quiet voice, Agatha Cheale continued:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I put the strawberries on one side, partly because I had
before me the disagreeable task of giving notice to a servant.
I forgot about the strawberries till early afternoon. I then
put them on a Chinese dessert dish, and took them upstairs
myself. I placed them on a chest of drawers outside Mrs.
Garlett’s room——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then came a long pause. Jean’s heart was beating—beating.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I will swear they were gone when I saw the man
I took to be a workman in the corridor. I thought no
more of them till Mrs. Garlett first summoned me in the
night.... Mrs. Garlett did not say they had been given
her by her husband. I will swear to that.... I’m quite
aware that everything I’m now saying is being said on oath....
She said, ‘The strawberries upset me. I ought not
to have taken them.’ She had had several visitors that
afternoon.... I cannot remember who they were.
She was very fond of seeing people when fairly well.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In a low hesitating voice came the words: “Must I go into
details of Mr. Garlett’s sojourn in the war hospital, my
lord?”... Then with a kind of cry—“He always behaved
like a gentleman to me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>There followed what seemed to the listener a very long
silence, and Jean was just turning away to go upstairs, when
again Agatha Cheale began speaking in an excited, defiant
voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly not! This is the very first time I have ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>seen an anonymous letter.... I <i>am</i> looking at it. I
entirely deny that.... I can’t help what any expert
says.... I don’t want to look at it again.... I
did not know Miss Bower—she was never at the Thatched
House that I know of.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then there followed complete silence, broken now and
then by a moan from the sleeping woman on the other side
of the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>The eavesdropper stood up. She walked slowly across the
landing, and made her way, hardly breathing, up the narrow
stairway.</p>

<p class='c008'>What did all that confused, broken talk portend? She
tried to piece the sentences together to make sense of them,
but the whole formed a hopeless jumble in her weary brain,
and when she reached her comfortless bedchamber she
poured a small dose of sleeping draught into a medicine
glass, and, lying down, soon fell into a troubled sleep.</p>

<p class='c008'>At six o’clock her alarm rang out. She jumped out of bed
and went over to the bathtub. Oh, how cold the water was
and how cold she felt with this sorry substitute for the comfortable
bathroom at Bonnie Doon! But a good rub with
a rough towel made her feel a good deal warmer. She
dressed quickly and went downstairs, feeling her way till
she reached the hall. There was a thin line of light under
the invalid lodger’s door, and as she passed it Jean heard
his stifled, painful cough.</p>

<p class='c008'>Going into the kitchen, she laid and lit the fire. Then,
acting on impulse, at seven she boiled a little water and
took Mrs. Lightfoot a cup of nice hot tea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, child, this is very kindly of you, and no mistake!
You’re the first of my ’elps that ’as hever done such a thing
as bring me a cup o’ tea afore I got up in the morning. But
there—you’ll not suffer from being kind. You shall ’ave
two eggs instead of the one I meant you to ’ave for your
breakfast. No Chinese eggs for me! Good English new-laid,
that’s all <i>I</i> has any use for. Now, you start getting
ready the breakfasts. Hall ’ave to be early stirrers and
early risers in this ’ouse—hall but Miss Cheale, that is.
She’s not expected to be down at ’er place till near eleven.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For the next hour Jean was kept very busy, doing the
kitchen and helping with the breakfast. At last she took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>up Mr. Robins’s breakfast tray, while Mrs. Lightfoot took up
Mr. Goodbody’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>As for the mysterious gentleman who occupied the back
room on the ground floor, he had a specially big breakfast—a
quarter of a pound of the best butter all to himself. Jean
remembered the words: “’E’s paid for separately because ’e’s
an hinvalid. You’ll ’ave nothing to do with ’im,” and sure
enough in that one case Mrs. Lightfoot did not ask her to
help in any way, save to carry the heavy tray to the top of
the kitchen staircase.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, at last, the two sat down together to their breakfast,
and after a few moments Mrs. Lightfoot suddenly observed:
“Did Miss Cheale gabble a bit in ’er sleep last night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said Jean in a low voice, “she did.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There now! But you’ll soon get used to it. The minute
she drops off, she is in the witness-box, poor soul! That’s
what’s unsettling of ’er, though she do believe she’ll get that
villain, Garlett, off.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean started so violently that the other noticed it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter with you? Got a pain?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just a little pain,” said Jean, trying to smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll get used to the stairs hafter a day or two. Just
pour yourself hout another cup of tea and start your second
hegg—that’ll make you feel better.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think I want another egg,” said Jean.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nonsense!” said Mrs. Lightfoot severely. “The hegg’s
been cooked, and you’ve got to eat it. I won’t ’ave any
waste in this ’ouse.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Does Miss Cheale really think she’ll get Mr. Garlett off?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She do, indeed! She thinks she saw the murderer—a
strange-looking chap ’e was—in the ’ouse that very hafternoon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Lightfoot leaned forward. “But it’s my belief, Bet,
that she’s just made that up! If so, they’ll soon find it
hout. She’ll never save ’im, bless you! She don’t know as
much as I do about murder.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Lightfoot smiled a broad cheerful smile. “My poor
’usban’ used ter say: ‘’Ow you can care to read about them
’orrible occurrences passes me, Jemima.’ But I’ve made a
special study of ’em from childhood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But if she thinks she can prove he’s innocent,” asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>Jean in a trembling voice, “why doesn’t she do it now? Why
wait for the trial?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now you’re askin’!” exclaimed Mrs. Lightfoot. “But
I’ll answer your question truly. Miss Cheale”—she fixed
her eyes on Jean’s pale face—“Miss Cheale,” she repeated,
“wants that man Garlett to know she’s saved ’im. Then
she thinks ’e’ll give up that girl Bower—and maybe marry
<i>’er</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Marry her?” repeated Jean. “How d’you mean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Cheale,” said Mrs. Lightfoot, “is sweet on that
villain ’erself. That’s been plain to me for a long time. If
not, why take on so? She saved the man’s arm, ’cordin’
to ’er account, when she was a nurse in France, and now she
means to save ’is life. She’s a deep one!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then she says she saw a stranger in the Thatched
House?” asked Jean. She was beginning to understand
much that had seemed oddly mysterious last night.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what she’s going to say, at any rate. One thing
I will tell you, Bet Chart. She do honestly believe Garlett
didn’t do it. She said so again to me last night. Funny,
wasn’t it? She says to me: ‘They say they’ve found the
place where Mr. Garlett bought the poison. ’E never did
buy any poison.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mean the thing that appeared in <cite>The Sunday Critic</cite>?”
said the girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, that’s what I do mean—but ’owever did you know
it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I saw the paper. A friend I stayed with the night before
I came here bought it, and showed me the paragraph.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Night and day the hidden drama went on—with the vast,
dark, melancholy old house as background.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the moment she went up to bed Jean Bower became
intensely herself—that is, the unhappy, agonizingly anxious
girl who was engaged to a man whom the whole world regarded
as a murderer.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, sometimes earlier, sometimes later, she would
be awakened by the now familiar sounds of Agatha Cheale
talking in her sleep, and, after a short battle with herself,
she would creep down to the floor below and listen to the
unseen speaker rehearsing the evidence she meant to give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>when in the witness-box at Harry Garlett’s trial for his
life.</p>

<p class='c008'>But what to the secret listener was so strange, as well as
bitterly disappointing, was that Agatha Cheale’s monologue
scarcely altered at all, from night to night. The suggestions,
assertions, indignant denials and admissions, would be repeated
again and again, in almost exactly the same form of
words. Indeed, as night followed night, there came a maddening
monotony about Jean Bower’s furtive eavesdropping
expeditions down to the dark landing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lying awake after she had again crept into her bed, Jean
would ask herself if there was any truth in the suggestion
that a stranger had broken his way into the Thatched House
on that fatal Saturday afternoon? And always she had to
agree with shrewd Mrs. Lightfoot that there had been no
stranger there. He was an invention, and a poor invention
at that, of Agatha Cheale.</p>

<p class='c008'>From seven each morning Jean Bower turned into Bet
Chart, “help” to the good-natured, talkative, monstrously
fat woman of whom the poor girl found herself getting fond,
in a sort of way.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now and again the “help” would hide herself behind the
door of the empty front room on the ground floor to see the
young lady who was the subject of so much interest and
speculation to every one in the house, pass through the
gloomy hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>Agatha Cheale was exceptionally well dressed, generally
in a well-cut blue serge coat and skirt, a handsome fur tippet,
and a smart little toque on her dark hair. She had
always been pale, and now her face looked absolutely bloodless.
There were deep, dark rings under her eyes—those
eyes which were the only beautiful feature of her thin, strong
face.</p>

<p class='c008'>Late each morning Bet Chart tidied Miss Cheale’s sitting
room, and “did” her bedroom; and when quite sure that Mrs.
Lightfoot would not make an unexpected appearance, she
would ashamedly open the drawers in the ramshackle dressing-table, and try the lid of the shabby old dispatch box
which stood close to Miss Cheale’s bed. But the box had
a patent lock, and its owner wore the key night and day,
according to Mrs. Lightfoot.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>As to the sitting room, it was bare and comfortless. On
the big, plain writing table stood a typewriter, and to its
right a wad of blotting paper, and a box of good notepaper
and envelopes to match. A bookcase full of books did
something to humanize the room. But Miss Cheale only
used the room as a place in which to have her tray meals,
and when she received her infrequent visitors.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, just nine days before what was to be the opening
day of Harry Garlett’s trial, Jean Bower did obtain conclusive
evidence concerning the authorship of the anonymous
letters which had first started the investigation.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had finished dusting Miss Cheale’s tidy, bare, little
sitting room when some sudden instinct made her do what
she had never done before. She moved, that is, the heavy
typewriter which stood on the writing-table.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under the board on which it stood lay a thin, fancy-paper
covered blotting book. She opened it, to find between
its leaves some sheets of thin, foreign-looking paper....</p>

<p class='c008'>Shaking with excitement and suspense, she took up the
top sheet and held it up between her eyes and the window.
Then, still with the sheet of paper in her hand, she rushed
up the ladder-like staircase, turned into her large bare garret,
opened the attaché case where she kept a few things under
lock and key, and took out the facsimile of the first of the
anonymous letters which had been given to her by James
Kentworthy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yes, there could be no doubt about it, the watermarks were
the same.</p>

<p class='c008'>She sank down on her bed, dizzy with conflicting feelings.
Then Lucy Warren had been right in her reluctantly expressed
suspicion! It was now certain that Agatha Cheale
had written the anonymous letters which had ultimately
caused Harry Garlett’s arrest on the awful charge of poisoning
his wife, and with a feeling of mingled excitement,
horror, and triumph, Jean Bower faced what seemed to her
the certainty of Agatha Cheale’s guilt.</p>

<p class='c008'>As she came back into the kitchen Mrs. Lightfoot looked up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, child, you do look bad!” she exclaimed. “I was
going to ask you to go hout and get a quarter of a pound of
butter, but I declare I’ll do it myself! I don’t want you laid
up!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>She put her podgy hand on the girl’s shoulder, and Jean
burst into tears and began to sob bitterly, “I’m all right,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c008'>At eight o’clock Jean summoned up courage to ask leave to
go out. She felt she must see Sir Harold Anstey to-night.
Considering the importance of what she had to tell him,
<i>to show him</i>, he could not object to her going to his private
address; a flat in Park Lane.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to go out this evening on some urgent business.
I hope you won’t mind, Mrs. Lightfoot? Would you lend
me a latchkey?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Lightfoot looked consideringly at the girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” she grumbled, “I don’t suppose I shall say ‘no,’
though ’tain’t, by rights, your hevening hout. But there!
Yes, Bet, you can go.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>It was nine o’clock, and Sir Harold Anstey had just
finished dinner. He had had an excellent meal and was enjoying
a good cigar. But he was in a very bad temper—a
rare state for him to be in—but a lady had been going to
dine with Sir Harold to-night, and at the very last moment
she had “chucked” him. He felt furious; also, what he was
not wont to feel: jealous.</p>

<p class='c008'>The telephone bell rang in the pantry and Sir Harold leapt
up from his chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A lady, Sir Harold, on the ’phone. She asked if you
were alone. She wouldn’t give her name. She said she’d
like to come along and see you for a little while, if you were
alone, and not too busy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say I shall be delighted to see her. And Gunn! I’ll
open the front door myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dear little woman! Her excuse that she had had to go
and see a sick friend had evidently been a true one.</p>

<p class='c008'>But even to his impatient heart, the sharp electric ring
came surprisingly soon.</p>

<p class='c008'>He hurried into his hall. But when he opened the door,
instead of the beautiful woman he expected to see, a slight,
shabbily dressed girl stood before him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is number eight,” he said shortly. “You have made
a mistake in the floor.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>“No, I haven’t, Sir Harold. I’m Jean Bower. I telephoned
and asked if you were alone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Bower? So it was you who telephoned? Come
in, by all means.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Though he tried to speak pleasantly, there was a marked
lack of cordiality in his voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As a matter of fact I am very busy this evening,” he
went on, “but of course, if you’ve anything important to say,
I will see you now for a few minutes, rather than to-morrow
morning in my chambers.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But as he ushered her into the sitting room, the lawyer
reasserted himself, and the mere man disappeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now, Miss Bower, what can I do for you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve found out that Agatha Cheale wrote those anonymous
letters. I think you will agree that this piece of paper provides
the proof.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Harold scrutinized closely the watermark which had
been so carefully drawn in on the facsimile of the first anonymous
letter. Then he held the thin piece of foreign paper
up to the lamp.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes—there’s no doubt about it,” he said decisively.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean looked at him anxiously. She had felt so absolutely
sure that he would be overjoyed at her discovery. Instead
of that there was a grim, almost an angry, expression on his
broad face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I fear that I am going to give you a shock, Miss Bower.
The whole situation has been changed most seriously to our
detriment by the fact that arsenic has been found in a house
actually belonging to Mr. Garlett.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As she was about to break in he put up his hand:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me have my say out, please—and then I will listen
to whatever you may have to say. I have something to
tell you concerning this woman, Agatha Cheale. She lately
communicated to the Prosecution a sworn statement that
she saw a stranger in the Thatched House on the afternoon
of Mrs. Garlett’s death. She further says she saw him close
to Mrs. Garlett’s bedroom door. The prosecution do not believe
this story, and neither does our side.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yet it may be true!” exclaimed Jean desperately.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great advocate went on as if he had not heard her:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now my theory is this: First, this woman, Agatha
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Cheale, was undoubtedly in love with Garlett; and she considered
herself very much aggrieved when she learned of the
man’s forthcoming marriage to yourself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He saw Jean’s face change, become discomposed, and,
speaking a little less harshly, he went on:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, come, you mustn’t mind hearing the truth! I
take it you would rather know the truth?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She bent her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Secondly, to me, and also, I may add, to my brethren
of the law on the other side, it soon became practically certain
that Miss Cheale had written the anonymous letters, so what
you have brought me to-night simply confirms our view.
Now, Miss Cheale, to the best of my belief”—he looked at
her significantly—“did this out of what I must call, saving
your presence, feminine spite. I am quite sure she had no
idea that Mrs. Garlett had met with anything but a natural
death. What she wished to do was to give Henry Garlett,
and no doubt yourself, too, a very unpleasant quarter of an
hour. If this theory is correct, the result of the exhumation
astounded her and caused her to realize that, thanks to her
spiteful action, the man to whom she seems to be still devoted
is in great peril of his life. This is why she has hit on the
absurd, though in such cases common, invention of a mysterious
stranger.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He stopped speaking, and in a strangled voice Jean exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“So what I’ve brought you to-night is not of the slightest
help, Sir Harold?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t say that! I’m glad you brought the proof to me
and not to the other side, for, of course, anything that tends
to discredit Miss Cheale discredits her mysterious stranger.
But I should not be a true friend, I should be a cruel friend”—and
now his voice did take on a far more kindly quality—“were
I to conceal from you, Miss Bower, that Henry Garlett
is in the very gravest danger. Till the admission made
by Miss Prince——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean made a quick movement of surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Miss Prince has at last brought herself to admit that
there was actually a considerable amount of arsenic kept
by her, carelessly, in an open cupboard at the Thatched
Cottage. You are, of course, aware that there was one all-important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>missing link in the chain of circumstantial evidence
connecting Henry Garlett with the death of his wife? That
link has now, I regret to say, been supplied.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As he saw the look of agony, of despair, on her young face
he hastened on:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not mean by all I have said, Miss Bower, that you
are to give up hope. On the contrary, if you can persuade
the jury that Garlett had not fallen in love with you before
his wife’s death, you will have gone a very long way to
destroy what, of course, the other side are relying on—Garlett’s
motive for committing this murder—if murder there
was.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If murder there was?” repeated Jean uncertainly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, for I am going most seriously into the question
whether or not Mrs. Garlett committed suicide. A large
quantity of white arsenic has been in Miss Prince’s possession
for many years. At one time, when in better health,
Mrs. Garlett was constantly at the Thatched Cottage. I
have found a woman who will tell the Court that Mrs. Garlett
had an extraordinary horror of vermin—of rats and of
mice—and I am going to raise the question as to whether
some years ago she did not persuade Miss Prince to give her
a small quantity of arsenic to destroy some rats which she
believed were infesting a portion of the Thatched House.
In that case Mrs. Garlett may well have kept some of the
arsenic by her, and, in a moment of depression or of pain,
administered it to herself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But even Sir Harold’s assured voice became less assured
as he put forward this unlikely theory.</p>

<p class='c008'>He concluded after a short pause:</p>

<p class='c008'>“The thing for you to do is to keep yourself as fit as
possible during the days that are now going to elapse before
the trial. Remember that everything may depend on your
making a good and, as I believe, an honest impression on the
jury.”</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Jean walked the whole way back to Coburg Square.
She was numb, spent with misery. For the first time
hope, that illusive yet infinitely comforting and uplifting
companion, had left her side, and she felt to-night as if he
had never been there. The knowledge that she had failed
to secure anything that really mattered by what now seemed
to her an absurd and inglorious adventure added to the load
of misery and discouragement she was now carrying.</p>

<p class='c008'>She made up her mind to go back to Terriford early to-morrow
morning, as the need for make-believe was past.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was nearly eleven o’clock when she reached the deserted
square. Quietly she turned the old-fashioned latchkey in
the big box lock. The hall was in darkness, but under the
ailing lodger’s door ran a thin streak of light. Did the poor
man never go to sleep?</p>

<p class='c008'>She felt her way down the kitchen stairs, and turning into
the kitchen, lit the gas.</p>

<p class='c008'>She felt extraordinarily wide awake, and yet tired, tired
to death! The thought of going up to the cold bedroom
where she had spent such excited hours of hope, suspense,
and, to-day, of triumphant satisfaction, filled her with a
feeling of sick depression. Suddenly she told herself that
she would stay down here, in this warm, comfortable kitchen
all night. Mrs. Lightfoot would never find it out, and if
she did—what matter?</p>

<p class='c008'>She made up the fire quietly. With luck there would still
be a remnant of warmth when she awoke to-morrow morning
at half-past six. She knelt down, but she found she could
not say the simple, trusting prayers she had said from childhood,
for she felt that God had forsaken her.</p>

<p class='c008'>She got up, and by the light of the fire she pushed forward
the black horsehair-covered armchair in which Mrs. Lightfoot
generally sat of an evening. Then she put her own
chair in front of it, and lay down.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>Tap&#160;... Tap&#160;... Tap....</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean awoke with a clutch of fear at her heart. Was that
the death watch of which her old nurse had once told her?</p>

<p class='c008'>She sat up on her improvised couch, and again there came
that strange sound repeated three times. But now, being
thoroughly awake, she knew them at once for what they
were—a signal, a summons, from the invalid lodger who
lived in the back room on the ground floor of the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean did not wait to strike a match, but went quickly to
the door. She was unwilling to be caught here, downstairs,
by Mrs. Lightfoot, so she walked on tiptoe past the housekeeper’s
bedroom, and then she ran lightly up the kitchen
stairs and knocked on the sick lodger’s door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come in!” called out a clear, well-modulated voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>She opened the door on a strange and, to her, a most unexpected
sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>The high, well-proportioned eighteenth-century room was
well and even luxuriously furnished. Green damask curtains
were drawn across the two windows. On the thick felt
carpet which covered the floor, stood a mahogany chest of
drawers and, facing the door, a high modern bedstead. By
the bed was a table bearing a reading lamp, which, though
shaded, lit up the finely shaped head and thin, bony face of
the man lying in the bed. His head was covered with a thick
thatch of fair hair, and he was propped up on three or four
pillows placed at his back.</p>

<p class='c008'>To Jean’s pitying eyes he appeared to be dying.</p>

<p class='c008'>And as she stood there, still close to the door outside the
circle of light cast by the lamp, she gradually took in other,
minor, details. There was a pile of books on the table, and
on the blue silk eiderdown a small volume was open, face
downward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mrs. Lightfoot?” said the invalid in a doubtful tone.
“I’m ashamed of having had to rouse you, but I feel much
less well to-night, also parched with thirst.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean took a few steps forward. “I’m Mrs. Lightfoot’s
‘help.’ And as Mrs. Lightfoot is asleep I thought it better
to come up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>An amazing change came over the pallid face—it was
suddenly animated with keen curiosity and cynical amusement.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>“Bet Chart?” he exclaimed. “And most perfect of Hebes,
according to good old Lightfoot. Come hither, fair
maid——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean moved back rather than forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What can I do for you?” she said quietly. “If you will
tell me what it is you wanted Mrs. Lightfoot for—I will
do it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He raised himself painfully on his right elbow and gave
her a long, measuring, penetrating look.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come nearer,” he said in an authoritative voice. “You’ve
nothing to be afraid of from the poor dying wretch I am
now——”</p>

<p class='c008'>She came close up to the bed; and then, looking up at her,
he said in a very different tone: “Your name is not Bet
Chart; you are Miss Jean Bower, of Terriford village.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She clasped her hands together.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s true!” she cried, oppressed, bewildered. “But for
God’s sake don’t give me away to Mrs. Lightfoot——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I won’t. And now tell me how is it that Dr.
Maclean’s niece comes to be here, in 106, Coburg Square?”
And his sunken eyes were alive with a mocking, mischievous
curiosity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of answering his question, she said again, “What
can I do for you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, noticing that behind the pile of books was an
empty glass, “D’you want something to drink?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did—horribly. But now I’m no longer thirsty—or,
rather, I’m only thirsty for information.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was amazing to see how he had changed in the last few
minutes, and yet the long outlines of his body under the
eiderdown looked like those of a skeleton.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean Bower looked round.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The milk and soda water are over there—quite out of
my reach. You may have already observed that Mrs. Lightfoot
has nothing in common with Florence Nightingale.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She turned and saw that on the chest of drawers there
stood a siphon and a jug of milk. She went over and
brought them both back with her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“D’you remember the scrumptious refreshments at that
cricket match, Miss Bower?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked down into his pallid, smiling face, and as she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>met the direct glance of his heavy-lidded gray eyes, there
came over Jean Bower a strong feeling that she had seen him
before.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t you guess who I am?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She shook her head. “I have no idea who you are! Mrs.
Lightfoot has never mentioned your name.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he said, in a singular tone: “Why should I make a
foolish mystery of it? My name is Guy Cheale. I am
Agatha’s brother. But she hates illness, and as it makes her
wretched to see me in this state—well, we don’t often meet.
It’s my fault I haven’t a nurse.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then all at once his hand shot out—his bony left hand—and
took hold of her dress.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know now why you’re here,” he exclaimed. “How
stupid of me not to guess it! You’ve come to spy on Agatha.
But, believe me, Miss Bower, you’re on the wrong track.
You’re not going to help your friend that way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know that now,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s nothing to find out about Agatha—nothing that
will help you, at any rate. I suppose you know that she and
Garlett were once great friends?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s not true,” she said the words with passionate conviction.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not true?” he repeated. “Absolutely true! But one
thing I’ll grant you. Agatha was the one who cared. He
didn’t care—not even in the war hospital when he was so
lonely. But she thought he did!”</p>

<p class='c008'>As if speaking to himself, he added: “And I thought so,
too. I used to think that if anything happened to his wife,
to use the conventional paraphrase for death—sweet, delicate
death—he would marry Agatha.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean stared down at him. She was torn with conflicting
feelings in which repulsion and anger for the moment predominated.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid you are very unhappy,” he said suddenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>She whispered, “Very unhappy,” and yet, though what he
had said about his sister and Harry Garlett both disturbed
and offended her, it was an astonishing relief to find herself
with some one with whom she could be herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bring up that chair,” he said in a low voice, “and let us
talk it over.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>She brought the chair close to the bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ask yourself what use was Mrs. Garlett’s life even to
herself, and imagine, for the purposes of our argument, that
your worthy rector, Mr. Cole-Wright, having in him a secret
strain of what some people call madness, but what I should
term supernormal sense, told himself that it would be a duty—I
will not say a pleasure, but a duty—to send this poor
woman to the heaven in which both he and she absolutely
believe. Is that an utterly unreasonable supposition?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said Jean, in a low voice, “utterly unreasonable.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A sensation of mingled excitement, pain and indignation
filled her heart. She felt she was doing wrong in staying
with this strange, sinister, cruel-natured man a moment
longer than was absolutely necessary. Yet he exercised a
certain fascination over her, and again she felt what a real
relief it was to be talking to some one with whom she need
not pretend.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be hurt, Miss Jean, at my teasing you—for of
course I am teasing you! I quite realize that in our present
state of civilization the putting away of a human being is a
serious thing—and not to be encouraged. Doctors alone are
licensed by public opinion, as well as by decrees passed by
themselves, to commit what other people call murder.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She remained silent, and after a long pause, during which
his eyes seemed to hold hers in fee, he asked abruptly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“When is Harry Garlett’s trial coming on?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In nine days.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s very near,” he muttered, “nearer than I thought.
Are you dreading the witness-box? My sister is horribly
afraid of it—I know that much about her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She made no answer to that, and he muttered: “Poor
little girl—poor, pretty little girl. Too bad! Too bad!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And again Jean Bower felt sure they had met—nay, even
more, that he had uttered pitying, familiar words to her
before. But as to when and where, memory supplied no
clue.</p>

<p class='c008'>Guy Cheale lay back on his pillows. He closed his eyes,
and Jean felt a pang of sick fear. Ought she to call his sister
and Mrs. Lightfoot?</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly he opened his eyes. “Your guardian angel
surely brought you here to-night.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>“Why?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In order that I might cheer you up by telling you that
Harry Garlett is sure to be acquitted, to be given, as it were,
the benefit of the doubt.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What makes you say that?” asked Jean in a trembling
tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was sobbing now, bitterly. He leaned over with
difficulty and took her soft right hand in his bony fingers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not,” he exclaimed, “because I believe in British justice—far
from it—but there’s just one little fact that will save
him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked at him, all her soul now in her eager eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What fact?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The fact,” he said deliberately, “that no arsenic has been
traced to Garlett’s possession. Practically all the resources
of the Crown have been used to find where he procured the
arsenic—and they have failed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They have not failed,” said Jean quietly, “in finding
where Harry could have procured arsenic. I saw Sir Harold
Anstey this evening. He told me that Miss Prince, who is
a doctor’s daughter and lives close to the Thatched House,
has now admitted that she kept quite a lot of arsenic in her
medicine cupboard. Miss Prince is Harry’s tenant——”</p>

<p class='c008'>The sick man dropped her hand and stared at her in dismay.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My God!” he muttered. “That is a bit of rough luck.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m going home to-morrow,” Jean went on drearily.
“There’s nothing left for me to do here. I’m sorry to be
going so—so abruptly, because Mrs. Lightfoot has been very
kind to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, she’s a good old soul.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He lay back and again shut his eyes. His face had gone
very gray. For a moment neither of them spoke. Then
he opened his eyes wide again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“D’you know Lucy Warren?” he asked in a singular tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>And suddenly Jean remembered the talk there had been
concerning poor Lucy and the strange man who lay there
dying before her, his body disintegrating, while his mind, his
intellect, remained so sound and clear.</p>

<p class='c008'>The colour rushed into her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I know her quite well.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>“Lucy’s a good girl,” he said thoughtfully, and then, “I
didn’t behave well to Lucy, Miss Bower.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid you didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did she tell you so?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lucy has never mentioned you to me. I don’t believe
she’s ever spoken of you to anybody.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want you to do something for me,” there was a touch
of urgency in his voice. “It’s to take down a message for
Lucy at my dictation, and then, in the morning, to telegraph
it to her. You will find some money over there in a drawer.
I’d write it myself, but I’m too weak.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There came a spot of colour into his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s a paper and pencil near where the siphon stood
just now. I used to write notes to my sister, but I can no
longer manage it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean brought what he asked for, and then he dictated,
scarce hesitating for a word:</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Lucy Warren, The Thatched Cottage, Terriford, Grendon.
This conveys an offer of marriage from one who is your devout
lover. I am dying, and I want you. Lose not an hour. Come at
once to 106, Coburg Square, London.—<span class='sc'>Guy Cheale.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a matter of supreme indifference to me that the postmistress
of that gossiping little place should know the truth,
and the doctor who looks after me here is a good chap.
He’ll arrange about getting the ring, parson, bell, and book.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As she looked at him, dazed, he said with a slight smile:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Death-bed marriages are not as unusual as you may
happen to think them, Miss Bower. And if there were more
such marriages, there would be fewer unhappy wives.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She smiled wanly, and in the midst of her own wretchedness,
felt glad that Lucy would have her heart’s wish.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They were more merciful in the old days,” muttered Guy
Cheale. “In the days of the rack and the stake, any poor
wretch in prison for murder could marry his sweetheart.
You’re sorry that’s not the case now, eh, Miss Jean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said Jean, looking down at him. “I am very sorry
that that’s not the case now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Still there are various forms of prison, you know? I’m
in prison here—very much in prison, if I may say so. Oh,
how I’ve got to loathe the look of this room—for all poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>Agatha tried to make it comfortable for me! I little thought
when I first arrived here—only six weeks ago, Miss Bower—that
it would become my marriage room. But in life—now
don’t forget this, for it’s the last thing I shall say to you—in
life it’s the strange, the unexpected, the astounding thing
that as often as not happens——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s true,” she said heavily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve got an idea—a good idea, too! I’ll be your mediator
with the outraged Lightfoot. I’ll tell her you had to go
away—that it was really urgent. And then I’ll break to her
that a new help is coming—a good worker, too, much more
experienced than poor little Bet Chart is ever likely to be.
A tall, dark, magnificent-looking girl, with a will of her own,
mind you. So then Lucy will be sure, I won’t say of a welcome—but
of a greeting.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She leaned down and began to shake up his pillows.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give Mrs. Lightfoot her cup of tea before you steal
away,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>And as he caught a look of surprise in her face:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mrs. Lightfoot is my only friend. If it wasn’t that she
is such a good, kindly-natured human creature, God knows
what I should have done with myself. Well, good-bye, good
luck, and thank you for what you’re going to do for me.
You won’t be sorry, Miss Bower, that you’ve obliged a dying
man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sorry?” she said. “No, indeed, Mr. Cheale, I shall
always be very glad we’ve had this talk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope I shall,” he said doubtfully, and helplessly began
to cough.</p>

<p class='c008'>She stood quietly by his side till the painful paroxysm was
over, and then:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-bye,” she said, torn between a feeling of intense
pity and almost equally intense repulsion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good luck!” he exclaimed. “And remember that in this
country we are taught to believe that no innocent man is ever
wrongly convicted.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A queer, mocking smile came over his face, and then once
more he began to cough, and again she waited, till the painful
sounds ceased.</p>

<p class='c008'>After giving Mrs. Lightfoot a cup of tea, she wrote a note
of what she felt to be lame apology, and, leaving it on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>kitchen table, crept out and went to the nearest post office.</p>

<p class='c008'>The young woman who accepted the strangely worded
telegram for transmission looked very hard at Jean Bower:</p>

<p class='c008'>“This a practical joke, or what?” she asked suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean answered soberly: “No, it’s not a joke. It’s exactly
what it pretends to be—an offer of marriage from a dying
man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some girls seem to have all the luck! Forty-one words.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>Jean was so tired that she slept away the journey which
would otherwise have been so full of disappointed, bitter
thoughts, and she felt as if she had been away months instead
of days when she came out into the big station yard of Grendon,
and saw her Uncle Jock’s familiar two-seater with him
at the wheel waiting for her. He had not come on to the
platform to greet her, and for that she was grateful, for she
was shrinkingly aware that there were prying eyes and
listening ears everywhere—everywhere, that is, where she
was recognized as the heroine of “The Terriford Mystery.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Maclean said very little while he drove his niece to
Bonnie Doon. It was not till after she had taken off her
things and come downstairs, feeling so strange, so little at
home there, that it seemed almost impossible to believe she
had been so short a time away, that her aunt suddenly asked:
“I suppose Kentworthy has told you about Miss Prince?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jean answered slowly: “I’ve seen Sir Harold Anstey, and
he told me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She came and told me, of all people in the world,” said
the doctor ruefully. “Let me see—it must have been two
days before you went away. It gave me an awful shock.
I could think of nothing else, and yet of course I was bound,
professionally, to keep the fact to myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He hit the table with his hand. “I have always disliked
that woman!” He turned to his wife. “You can bear me
out in that, Jenny, eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ay,” she said, “and sometimes I did not think you were
quite reasonable about it, Jock. But now I see how right
you were. Miss Prince must have had enough poison in that
medicine cupboard of hers to have killed every man, woman,
and child in the place!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Jean suddenly got up.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>“I think I would like to go a walk by myself,” she said.
“I didn’t get half walking enough while I was in London.”</p>

<p class='c008'>After she had shut the door behind her, husband and wife
looked at one another.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t but be glad that she doesn’t yet realize that Garlett’s
as good as hanged already,” said the doctor sombrely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think she does realize it,” said Mrs. Maclean pitifully.
“You weren’t watching her face while we spoke of Miss
Prince. Fancy her having got into touch with Sir Harold
Anstey!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was a bit of a surprise to me,” admitted the doctor.
“But not all the Ansteys in the world could get off yon man
Garlett now.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>EPILOGUE</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c011'>I</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>It is a cold windy March morning. The trial of Henry
Garlett has been fixed for ten o’clock, but since before eight
o’clock there has been a crowd, growing larger and larger
every minute, round the stately pillared portico of the Grendon
Assize Court. The crowd has been compelled to spread
out fan-fashion, owing to the stout walls which stretch on
either side of the building, and women form by far the
larger proportion of those who are determined to obtain
places in the public galleries and in those seats, behind the
jury, reserved for certain privileged persons.</p>

<p class='c008'>These would-be spectators of Henry Garlett’s ordeal, and
of Jean Bower’s agony, belong to all classes, and are of all
ages. Some of the women there have walked ten miles and
more, this morning, to be present at the trial of the man who
a short six months ago was the most popular figure in the
whole countryside.</p>

<p class='c008'>Motor cars of every make and of every type are drawn up
on the edge of the ever-growing crowd. Many of these
motors are filled with well-dressed women, who have come
provided with opera glasses. They have sent their servants
to keep places in the queues which are already pressing
round each of the three big doors. But soon it becomes
known that the police will not allow this convenient plan,
and to their disgust the ladies have to step out of their comfortable
cars, and stand cheek by jowl with their humbler
fellow women.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great majority of the people who are waiting there on
this cold morning have brought some form of food with
them, for they mean to keep in their places all day, so as not
to lose even the smallest thrill connected with what is indifferently
called the Garlett Case and the Terriford Mystery.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is known that there will be four important witnesses—Garlett
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>himself, the famous amateur cricketer; Jean Bower,
for whose sake, in the opinion of the vast majority of those
who will be present at the trial, he committed a dastardly and
cruel murder; Miss Prince, the spinster whose tardily tendered
evidence is said to be of vital importance, though no
one as yet knows of what that evidence consists; and last,
though not least, Agatha Cheale, the mystery woman of the
strange story.</p>

<p class='c008'>Most of the men who have come, some of them very long
distances, on cycles, in motors, in old-fashioned horse-drawn
vehicles, and on their own feet, are looking forward to seeing
Dr. Maclean in the box. Few of those in that ever-growing
crowd but have come across the kindly Scots doctor, either as
his patients themselves, or because of the illness of some one
dear to them. But that makes no difference to their eager
wish to see him cross-examined—heckled, as it would be
called in his own country—by the celebrated Sir Harold
Anstey.</p>

<p class='c008'>At half-past nine the doors are thrown open to the public
and the struggle for places begins. There are some ugly
rushes, with much pushing, kicking, and even pinching and
scratching, before the public galleries of the Court, which is
exceptionally large for a country Assize Court, are filled to
their utmost capacity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The reserved seats are few, and they, too, are soon almost
unpleasantly crowded with a number of pretty, well-dressed
women, some with attendant squires to whom they are talking,
while they glance with keen, curiosity-laden eyes at the
unfamiliar scene.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the well of the Court already the solicitors’ clerks are
busy at wide tables; the long bench which will soon be occupied
by the witnesses is empty; and so is the railed-in dock,
where the prisoner will soon be standing, exactly opposite
the high, throne-like seat from which the judge, the keen and
redoubtable Mr. Justice Freshwater, will direct the proceedings.
It is known that this old-fashioned judge does not
approve of ladies being present at murder trials, and accordingly
the seats to his right and left will be occupied by his
men friends and not by their wives.</p>

<p class='c008'>The minutes go by fairly quickly for most of the people
there, for almost everybody is talking to his or her neighbour.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>Also there is the excitement of watching the various parties
connected with the case come slowly in.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first of the witnesses to arrive are Dr. Maclean and his
niece, and a stir runs through the Court as they come in.
Every eye is fixed on Dr. Maclean’s slight companion. Jean
Bower is quietly dressed in a black coat and skirt, and a
simple little hat with a touch of blue in it. She looks absolutely
self-possessed, though very pale.</p>

<p class='c008'>Somehow the sight of her irritates some of the spectators;
they had expected a tragic figure, wrapped, maybe, in long,
concealing veils; they tell each other disappointedly that she
looks a very ordinary young woman. True, she is curiously
pale, but then perhaps she is naturally pale.</p>

<p class='c008'>There come in various other witnesses of no particular
interest, or at least not yet of any particular interest. Then,
all at once there appear, walking side by side, a young and an
old lady. Again a stir runs through the court.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s Miss Prince,” some one says in a loud excited
voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince hears the words, and draws herself up somewhat
haughtily. She is wearing a coat and skirt, and a
plain, unbecoming round felt hat. The young lady with
Miss Prince is dressed more in accordance with the popular
idea of a female witness. She is heavily veiled—and looks
indeed almost like a mourner at a funeral. The word is
passed round that this is no other than Agatha Cheale.</p>

<p class='c008'>She and Miss Prince walk past the other witnesses with
averted eyes, and sit at the extreme end of the long bench.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ten o’clock strikes, and now comes the moment when the
judge, who embodies the majesty, the terror, the splendour of
British justice, walks with slow, rhythmic steps to his place.
He is a tall man, and shows off his red robes, deep ermine
bands, and full-bottomed wig to great advantage. He sits
himself down, gives one long stern glance round the crowded,
now silent Court, and then he bends his head and busies himself
with the notes and other documents laid on the high desk
before him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now the legal lights concerned with the case begin to
stream in. Sir Harold Anstey, bustling, smiling, his great
frame well set off by his long black silk gown. His wig always
looks just a little too small for his huge head, but still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>there is something very impressive about his strongly marked
features and his keen eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>A great contrast, indeed almost a ludicrous contrast, is
Sir Almeric Post, the leading counsel for the Crown. Sir
Almeric is a thin man, and his wig looks too big for his head.
He has a hatchet-shaped face, narrow, compressed lips, a
straight nose, and two cold, thoughtful-looking gray eyes.
Unlike Sir Harold, who is keenly aware of his audience,
Sir Almeric does not even glance round the Court, but at once
engages in an earnest discussion with one of his juniors.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a slight stir when the jury stumble into their
places. The twelve good men and true are an extraordinarily
ordinary-looking collection. Still, every one of them
has a confident, self-important look. To some of those
present the reflection that those twelve men are going to
decide the awful question of a fellow being’s life or shameful
death brings with it a sensation of unease.</p>

<p class='c008'>By some mistake, which will be severely noted in to-morrow’s
Press, the newspaper men have not been allowed,
till now, to enter the Court. They file in and take the places
allotted to them. Jean Bower, though she has no reason to
love newspapers, tells herself that she wishes they composed
the jury rather than the stolid, rather stupid-looking, men
who are exactly opposite to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then at last, very quietly, so quietly that half the
people present do not immediately realize what is happening,
the prisoner is brought up from the cells below and walks
with firm step into the dock.</p>

<p class='c008'>Henry Garlett is dressed in a blue serge suit, and wears a
double collar and a black tie. He looks neither to the right
nor to the left, but bows slightly to the judge.</p>

<p class='c008'>Amid dead silence the clerk of assize reads the charge
setting forth that Henry Garlett feloniously and wilfully
murdered his wife, Emily Garlett.</p>

<p class='c008'>The prisoner, in a voice which though the words are not
loudly uttered is heard by every one present, says firmly:
“Not guilty, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The trial is now begun, and even the most frivolous spectators
settle down to listen to what will certainly be a terrible
and formidable indictment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Almeric Post, however, puts the case for the Crown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>quite simply, and as undramatically as possible. He tells,
in ordinary, everyday language, the story of the painful
death of Mrs. Garlett on the 27th of last May. He does
not hurry over it. He tells it indeed at some length. And
then he goes back to the past lives of the two people with
whom he is concerned.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a fair and passionless manner he describes the marriage
of the penniless youth, Henry Garlett, to the considerable,
not to say great, heiress, Emily Jones, and briefly mentions
the fact that there were no children. He gives full credit
to Garlett, as he calls him throughout, for his war service,
and then very gravely he tells how this still young man came
back to find his wife a hopeless, almost bedridden, invalid.
Lightly, skilfully he touches on Garlett’s great fame as a
cricketer, and he even reminds the jury of that memorable
match last spring, the first match played by the Australians
in the old country.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every one stiffens into eager attention, and even Sir
Almeric’s clear, toneless voice changes a little, when he utters
the words:</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now I come to a new figure in the story of Henry
Garlett and of Emily Garlett—I refer to Miss Jean Bower.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For the first time he glances down at the paper, covered
with pencilled notes, which he holds in his left hand; and
then he gives the precise date of the arrival of the pretty
young girl in Terriford village. He explains incidentally
that her home with Dr. and Mrs. Maclean is only some ten
minutes’ to a quarter of an hour’s walk from the Thatched
House. There follows an account of how Garlett had given
Jean Bower the position of official secretary to the limited
company of which he, Garlett, was managing director. And
just because Sir Almeric tells his tale in so simple and almost
bald a manner, most of those present somehow realize very
vividly how much may lie unsaid behind his measured words.</p>

<p class='c008'>He does not propose, he says, to call much evidence as to
the relations of these two people, but he will call three witnesses
who saw them coming home together by the field path
from Grendon to Terriford on the day which preceded Mrs.
Garlett’s death.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Both this man and this woman affirm,” he observes in a
considering voice, “that they were scarcely acquainted at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>that time, and yet they were sufficiently acquainted to walk
something like two miles in each other’s company, and
Henry Garlett brought Jean Bower through his own garden,
which, perhaps I ought in fairness to add, is something of a
short cut to Bonnie Doon, where she was then living with her
uncle and aunt.”</p>

<p class='c008'>All too quickly for some of the ghouls in the public gallery,
ay, and in the reserved seats, Sir Almeric sketches lightly
but firmly what happened immediately after the return of the
apparently disconsolate widower to the Thatched House.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is admitted by everybody concerned that from then
onward Henry Garlett, the managing director of the Etna
China works, and Jean Bower, official secretary of the company,
became inseparable. Soon all the factory hands were
commenting, though in no disagreeable way, or so I am informed,
on their close friendship. I will bring to your notice
the fact that Garlett, though besieged with invitations from
old friends and acquaintances, scarcely ever went away during
those autumn weeks. Now and again he took a Saturday
to Monday off, but on the whole he stuck close to his
work.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Almeric waits a few moments, and a glass of water is
handed to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now, gentlemen, we come to a number of significant
occurrences. Early in November these two people became
betrothed. I cannot tell you the exact date of the engagement,
which was kept more or less private by the wish of Dr.
Maclean and his wife. But it is admitted that by early
December this so-called private engagement was known to
the whole of Terriford, and, as a matter of fact, the date of
the marriage was actually fixed for December 19th.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Almeric ends his opening for the prosecution with a
strange, dramatic suddenness, and calls in quick succession
half a dozen witnesses, of whom by far the most important
is Dr. Maclean.</p>

<p class='c008'>The worthy physician’s ordeal does not last as long as was
expected. He is taken through Mrs. Garlett’s long illness,
and describes in very clear language her condition just before
the night of her fatal illness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he is made to narrate at length the circumstances of
Mrs. Garlett’s death—how he was fetched by the sick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>woman’s husband, such a thing having never happened before—how
Garlett showed a strange unwillingness to go
upstairs, and how the witness then, proceeding alone through
the sleeping house, suddenly encountered the parlour-maid,
Lucy Warren. Finally, how, after a short colloquy with
Miss Cheale, he turned his attention to the sick woman and
discovered that she was dead.</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor makes it clear that, to the best of his belief,
Mrs. Garlett was already dead when he arrived at the house;
and then he explains somewhat haltingly why it was that he
then made up his mind that his patient had died from heart
failure.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the course of his evidence Dr. Maclean has naturally
mentioned Agatha Cheale several times, and so, at the end of
the doctor’s cross-examination and re-examination, the judge
leans forward and asks Sir Almeric: “Are you going to call
Miss Cheale now?” And Sir Almeric says, no, he is not
going to call Miss Cheale yet. He would prefer to call
certain witnesses who will testify as to the relations between
the prisoner and Miss Bower both before and after Mrs.
Garlett’s death.</p>

<p class='c008'>Five people then follow one after the other into the box—three
men and two women. The two women each declare
that they thought it very strange that a pretty young lady
should be made secretary of the company, and one of them,
a forewoman, identifies a letter she had written to her sister
containing the strangely prophetic sentence: “If anything
was to happen to the missus, I should never be surprised if
Miss B. became his second.”</p>

<p class='c008'>An overseer at the factory swears that as early as October
1st—he remembers the date because it was his birthday—he
told his wife that he hadn’t a doubt that “the boss was
sweet on Miss Bower.” But he asserts that he had also
expressed surprise because he had never noticed anything of
the kind before Mr. Garlett went away.</p>

<p class='c008'>That fact is eagerly taken hold of by Sir Harold Anstey,
and there follows a keen cross-examination. The great advocate
makes some facetious remarks on love and on love-making
generally, and the Court for the first time enjoys
what perhaps Sir Harold would describe as “a little fun.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Titters even come from the witnesses’ bench, but Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Prince looks severe, almost disgusted, and as for Jean
Bower, the girl becomes even paler than she was before. The
prisoner in the dock looks straight before him while all this
goes on—he might be carved in stone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Call Miss Agatha Cheale!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The words ring through the court, and a thickly veiled figure
walks quickly round to the steps leading to the witness-box.
But as she puts her second foot upon the ladder-like
steps she trips and would have fallen but for one of the Court
officials, who seizes her arm and pulls her to her feet again.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Cheale is sworn and throws back her veil at the
judge’s bidding. She, too, is then taken through the story
of the death night. To the surprise of many of those present
she speaks in a composed, almost mincing, voice. She is
asked what happened the afternoon before Mrs. Garlett’s
sudden death, and in reply she tells what has come to be
called the “strawberry story”—that is, she explains how the
strawberries were left by Miss Prince, how she put them on
a plate outside Mrs. Garlett’s door immediately after luncheon,
and then, how, late in the afternoon, having occasion
to go upstairs, she distinctly saw a strange man making his
way quickly down the passage.</p>

<p class='c008'>She adds a detail of considerable interest. This is that
she noticed that the plateful of strawberries had disappeared.
She adds that this fact was noticed by her quite half an hour
before Mr. Garlett went up to his wife’s room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Harold Anstey, when cross-examining Agatha Cheale,
naturally plays up to the story she has told. His object now
is to increase, not diminish, the witness’s credit. He draws
out of her her very high opinion of both Mr. and Mrs. Garlett.
She tells the Court what a devoted couple they were,
and how excellent a husband Mr. Garlett was. In fact, she
can’t speak too well of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Miss Cheale has a few unpleasant moments to live
through while she is re-examined by Sir Almeric. He
presses her very hard, very ruthlessly, about her mysterious
stranger. Does she really believe that the stranger she saw
hastening down the passage committed the murder? She
answers emphatically that yes, she does believe it. Has she
anything that could account for such a monstrous and
motiveless crime on an unknown man’s part? She replies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>that there is a type of criminally minded human being who
does commit motiveless crimes. Criminal lunatic asylums
are full of them.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>II</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>“Call Miss Prince!”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a look of tense excitement on almost every face
in the crowded court-house when the tall, angular figure of
Miss Prince steps up, composedly, into the witness-box.
Even the dullest witted of the spectators present is aware by
now that her evidence will be crucial, one way or the other,
to the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c008'>While she is being sworn, the man in the dock, Henry
Garlett, looks at her with a long, steady, rather sad look.
The sight of Miss Prince reminds him with painful vividness
of his wife, of “poor Emily.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He is the one person in Court who does not realize the
fearful import of the evidence she is about to tender. For
one thing, he is well aware that he has only been to the
Thatched Cottage on one occasion in two years, and he does
not yet understand how very difficult it is to prove a negative.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Almeric Post, for the Prosecution, begins his examination
of this witness in a conversational tone. It is almost as
if he were calling on Miss Prince in her own house, and
asking her a number of not very important questions. And
she also answers in a clear, decided voice, the voice that
some of the people of Terriford know only too well. It is
the voice of the admonitory Miss Prince, not that of Miss
Prince the eager gossip.</p>

<p class='c008'>Briefly she admits she is the daughter of the late Dr.
William Prince, that she helped her father in his dispensary,
and that when there came the break-up of her home and the
sale of the practice to Dr. Maclean, she thought it within her
right to take with her to the Thatched Cottage what drugs
were left in her father’s dispensary.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then there comes a sharp quickening of the public
interest, and even the judge leans forward. Sir Almeric
puts solemnly the question:</p>

<p class='c008'>“And among those drugs I understand that there was a
considerable quantity of arsenic in a stoppered glass jar?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There was,” she answers in a clear voice.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>“Is it also a fact that the jar, marked with the word
‘arsenic’ printed on a blue label, stood open to the view of all
those who were in a position to glance up into your medicine
cupboard when it was open?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is so,” says Miss Prince in a lower tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now I want you to cast your mind back to last
spring.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince makes no answer, she simply looks quietly,
thoughtfully at her questioner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you do that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think so. Though of course it’s difficult for me to
swear to anything that may have happened on any special
day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You do, however, remember a late April storm which
caused the gutters of your house to overflow and which did
damage to the ceiling of a servant’s bedroom on the top
floor of your house?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince admits that she remembers the circumstance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now tell us in your own words what followed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wrote to Mr. Garlett, my landlord, and asked him if he
would personally come over to my house and see the damage
which had been done. We had never had a lawyer’s agreement.
I was an old friend, almost the oldest friend, of
Mrs. Garlett. And I was well aware that at any moment
the Thatched Cottage could have been let for a considerably
larger sum than the rent I was paying. On the other hand,
I felt that Mr. Garlett would not mind my asking him to
have the gutters of the house attended to. The expense,
considerable to me, would be, I felt, small to him; also I
should like to say that he was known to me as an exceptionally
generous man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a stir through the Court. The judge leans forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you kindly keep to the matter in hand, madam?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince does not look in the least disturbed by this
rebuke. She answers quietly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Would you prefer, my lord, that Sir Almeric should ask
questions and I give answers?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince had once stayed in the company of Sir
Almeric at a country house many years ago, and she feels
quite at ease with him.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>“No,” says the Judge sharply, “go on with your story.
But keep to the matter in hand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Garlett sent me a note saying that he would try and
make time to come and see the damage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Another bustle in Court. “Is that note among the exhibits?”
There is a hurried looking over of the papers
scattered on the table where sit the Crown lawyers in pleasant
amity with the prisoner’s solicitor, Mr. Toogood. Yes, the
letter is here; Sir Almeric holds it up before Miss Prince.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is this the letter?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I certify that that is the letter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“As a matter of fact, Miss Prince, you did not actually
receive a visit from Mr. Garlett. But you think it almost
certain that he came in one day when you happened to be
out?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince hesitates. “I cannot say that I consider it
almost certain.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Almeric says quickly: “We have a witness who will
swear that you told her you regarded it as practically certain
that Mr. Garlett did visit your house to look at the gutters.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince for the first time shows some discomfort.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I may have said that,” she answers in a low voice, “but
now that I am speaking on oath I wish to reassert the fact
that I am not certain Mr. Garlett ever came to my house.
The only certain thing is that he sent in his builder, and that
the gutters were cleaned out and repaired.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it or is it not a fact that your medicine cupboard was
often left open—the door of it, that is, unlocked?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Almeric’s voice now takes a somewhat unpleasant edge.
He had understood that Miss Prince would be a very willing
witness against Henry Garlett.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am sorry to say that is true. The key did not work
properly, and as I am constantly taking things out of my
medicine cupboard, cough mixture and so on, for the village
folk who come to consult me, I did get into the bad habit
of leaving the cupboard door unlocked.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is also a fact, is it not, Miss Prince, that you are constantly
in and out of your house—in other words in and out
of Terriford village?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And during the month of April you were constantly in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>attendance on a dying woman who had been, or so I understand,
for many years in your father’s service. Now,
who looked after the house while you were out?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“During some of the time,” says Miss Prince hesitatingly,
“I only had a woman from the village to come in and do
for me; therefore, the house was frequently left empty.
But when that was the case one of Mr. Garlett’s gardeners
was generally about the place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Still, the house was often empty. Do you always lock
your back door and your garden door as well when you
leave home, or are they sometimes left open? Be careful,
Miss Prince, as to your answer to this question.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince hesitates, but only for a moment. She knows
only too well what her answer must be.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I always locked the back door, that giving access to
the kitchen, when I left the house empty,” she says in a
low voice. “The garden door, which only communicates
with the garden of the Thatched House, was generally left
open.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There follows a long pregnant silence. And then there
runs a strange convulsive sigh through the Court, for the
majority of those present realize that by the admission she
has just made Miss Prince has gone far to sign Henry Garlett’s
death warrant.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That means,” goes on Sir Almeric in the same quiet, emotionless
tone, “that any one last May could gain access to
the Thatched Cottage, and of course to your medicine room,
so long as he or she came through the grounds of the
Thatched House? It is, is it not, a fact that this entrance
to your house—I mean the garden-door entrance—is more
or less concealed by an evergreen hedge?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is so,” says Miss Prince.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To resume—nothing would have been easier for Mr.
Garlett than to go to your back premises, open the garden
door, and go upstairs to view the damage done by the rain
in the gutters?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would have been quite easy for him to do so,” replies
Miss Prince hesitatingly, “but to my mind it would have
been a very strange thing for a gentleman to do—to come
into a lady’s house without asking her leave, to go upstairs,
and, if I may say so, poke about!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>A titter runs through the Court.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Sir Almeric observes suavely: “A strange thing
to do, no doubt, but gentlemen, Miss Prince, have been
known to do very strange things if they had certain objects
in view.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At that there is again “laughter in Court.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now I ask you one last question: As far as you
know, was Mr. Garlett aware that there was arsenic in your
house?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince remains silent for what seems to her audience
a very long time. Once or twice the judge glances down
at her rather sharply, and then, just as he is about to ask
her if she has understood the question put to her, she answers
reluctantly, “Yes, I think Mr. Garlett was probably
aware of that fact. He cut his finger very badly about two
years ago, and came down to the Thatched Cottage to ask
me to bind it up for him. I took him up to my medicine
room, for of course I keep lint and bandages there. I remember——”
and then Miss Prince stopped short.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You remember, Miss Prince——?” says Sir Almeric encouragingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince turns to the judge. “Am I compelled to
answer, my lord, what it is that I remember?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Up leaps Sir Harold Anstey, and there follows between
the two great barristers a sharp interchange of words. But
at last the judge decides in favour of the prosecution, and
Miss Prince is instructed that she must state what it was
that she remembers.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then for the first time the witness becomes obviously
very nervous. In a low voice she very hesitatingly admits:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I remember that the door to my medicine cupboard
happened that day to be wide open, and that Mr. Garlett
and I had a talk about poisons. But I do not remember
that we mentioned arsenic.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again there comes that curious stir through the Court.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That will do, Miss Prince.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And indeed every one feels that Miss Prince has indeed
“done” for Harry Garlett.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Sir Harold Anstey takes the place left vacant
by the Crown counsel.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You told Sir Almeric, Miss Prince,” he begins, “that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>though you could cast your mind back to late April, it would
be impossible for you to remember what happened on any
special day at so great a distance of time. Yet during the
last few minutes you have shown yourself possessed of a
remarkable memory.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must remember,” replies Miss Prince quickly, “that
when I learned what had been the cause of my friend Mrs.
Garlett’s death, I realized at once that the only place in
Terriford where arsenic could have been procured was in
my house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You did not, however, see fit to reveal that very important
fact till quite lately. Even then, you did not reveal
it to the proper authorities. You told it to Dr. Maclean,
thus putting him in a very painful position——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I deeply regret now that I did not write to the prosecution
direct. But the Garletts had been my nearest neighbours
and friends, and I hoped against hope that my arsenic
had not been in question. I tried, in a quiet way, to find
out if Mr. Garlett had ever been seen in my house, and I
found that, as far as anybody knew, he never had been in
my house—with the one exception when he came to see me
about his cut finger—for two years or more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I put it to you, Miss Prince”—Sir Harold looks at her
fixedly—“that any one, by walking from the road into the
grounds of the Thatched House, could obtain access to your
house through the garden door?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is so,” assents Miss Prince eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Were any of your friends in the habit of using that
door?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, my friend Miss Agatha Cheale—Mrs. Garlett’s
housekeeper—always came into my house that way. So of
course did any servant bringing a message or a note from the
Thatched House to the Thatched Cottage. But you must
remember that there was the back door, used by the tradesmen
each morning, also the front door. I should like to
repeat my conviction that Mr. Garlett would not naturally
have thought of coming into my house by the garden door.
The time he came to see me after cutting his finger he came
to the front door.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Harold makes a note of this fact, and it is in a pleasant
voice that he asks:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>“As far as you know—and I gather you had many opportunities
of knowing—Mr. and Mrs. Garlett were on very
good terms the one with the other?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Excellent terms,” says Miss Prince emphatically.</p>

<p class='c008'>Deep in her heart she knows that her evidence has gone
far to ensure a conviction for murder against Henry Garlett,
and now she is anxious to give him the benefit of every
doubt that has ever assailed her during the last difficult anxious
weeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Sir Harold makes one of the few mistakes of his
brilliant professional life.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are acquainted,” he says, “with Miss Jean Bower.
I take it, Miss Prince, that you have a very high opinion of
that young lady?”</p>

<p class='c008'>There follows a pause—a terrible pause. It is as if all
in the crowded court-house are holding their breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know very little of Miss Jean Bower,” answers Miss
Prince coldly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alas, that gives Sir Almeric his chance when re-examining
Miss Prince. And he draws out of her with infinite skill,
not only that she does not think well of the unhappy girl
who will so soon stand where she is standing—that is, in
the witness-box—but that, on the very day which preceded
Mrs. Garlett’s sudden and terrible death, she actually saw
Jean Bower and Henry Garlett walking home together from
the Etna China factory.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Prince has proved a most damaging witness. Sir
Harold looks grim, preoccupied, and what his enemies call
“sour.”</p>

<p class='c008'>To the surprise of the Court, the next witness is Mr. Garlett’s
builder. He is only a short time in the witness-box and
what he says is regarded on the whole as bearing against his
employer. While he declares that, as far as he can remember,
Mr. Garlett had said nothing to him implying that he
had actually seen the gutters, he admits that Mr. Garlett
had shown a remarkable knowledge of the nature and extent
of the damage.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Sir Harold re-examines, he points out to the man
that the letter written by Miss Prince had given the most
detailed description of the havoc the rain and storm had
caused. Even so, on the whole the general impression of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>the Court is that the builder unwillingly believes that Mr.
Garlett had been to the house and seen the damage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every one is tired and just a little cross by now. Whatever
happens, people must eat, and it is long past one o’clock.
The prisoner is taken below. Judge, jury, and lawyers leave
the Court, and those spectators who are determined not to
lose their places take out their little packets of sandwiches.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a buzz of conversation. Bets are freely offered
and taken as to how long the trial will last. Only one man
present bets on an acquittal. He is a widower, and takes
the milk round Terriford village, and though some years
younger than Elsie MacTaggart, is supposed to be “sweet”
on her.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>III</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>At last the judge comes up and the officials stream in.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Call Jean Bower!”</p>

<p class='c008'>What all the people there have been waiting for with almost
savage longing is now about to take place, and every
eye in Court save the prisoner’s fastens on Jean Bower.</p>

<p class='c008'>The slight girlish figure ascends the steps into the witness-box.
She is painfully pale—her pallor enhanced by her
plain black coat and skirt. Yet, strange to say, Jean Bower
does not make a pleasant impression. She is too quiet, too
self-possessed. It is difficult to visualize her as the heroine
of a criminal love drama.</p>

<p class='c008'>After she has been sworn, Sir Almeric takes her through
the story which is now almost tiresomely familiar to most
of those present. She sticks firmly to the unlikely tale that
till the return of Henry Garlett, four months after his wife’s
death, he and she had been on terms of formal acquaintance—nothing
more.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then at last there comes the thrill for which all these
men and women who crowd the public galleries to suffocation
have been waiting.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose I may assume that after his return, this last
autumn, you became deeply attached to Mr. Garlett?”</p>

<p class='c008'>There follows a long pause—twice Jean Bower opens her
pale lips, but no answer comes from them. Then, slowly,
she bends her head.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>“Do you still love him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The question is asked in a hard, unemotional voice. But
it seems to galvanize the witness into eager, passionate, palpitating
life.</p>

<p class='c008'>She cries out strongly, almost triumphantly: “With all
my heart and soul.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The advocate for the Crown turns away. He has scored
a great point. The jury have doubtless been moved by
that cry of love and faith, but he, Sir Almeric Post, will soon
show them, with the pitiless logic for which he is famed,
that the very fact of this overwhelming passion discredits the
whole of the evidence Jean Bower has just tendered in so
lifeless and composed a manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>The entire crux of the case turns on what were the real
relations of Henry Garlett and Jean Bower before Mrs. Garlett’s
death. Were the girl to admit even warm innocent
friendship on her employer’s part she would be helping to
prove the case for the Crown. And now, who, with any
knowledge of feminine human nature, can doubt that she
has lied—<i><span lang="la">splendide mendax</span></i>, as the old Latin tag puts it—“a
splendid lie, but a lie all the same?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, Miss Bower; that will do,” he says suavely.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Sir Harold Anstey is taking the place of his brother
advocate in order to re-examine the unhappy girl who all
unwittingly has done his client such a fatal mischief by that
cry of devoted love, there is an unwonted stir, even a struggle,
at one of the doors. Across the now silent Court ring
out the words:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must speak now—I must speak now!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The judge leans forward, and Sir Harold turns round, a
frown on his face. For the moment public attention is
diverted from the slight figure in the witness-box.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Harold, after a whispered word with the Crown counsel,
observes:</p>

<p class='c008'>“One of the female witnesses has only just arrived, my
lord, and she seems to have become hysterical.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again the loud wailing, the unrestrained voice is heard:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must speak—I must speak <i>now</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hastily Sir Almeric takes a hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The young woman who desires so urgently to be heard,
my lord, was formerly parlour-maid at the Thatched House.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>I doubt, however, if she is in a fit condition to go into the
witness-box to-day at all. I understand she has just come
from her husband’s death-bed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The judge leans forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you regard her as an important witness, Sir Almeric?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, my lord. She was moving about the house during
the night of Mrs. Garlett’s death. Also she has evidence to
tender concerning the secret meetings which took place between
Henry Garlett and some unnamed young woman in a
wood before Mrs. Garlett’s death.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again there rises that strange, unnatural cry—loud, defiant:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I demand to be heard now! I have the right to be heard
now!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The judge frowns. He peers forward till he thinks he
distinguishes the hysterical young woman who has been
making such an unseemly disturbance, and then he says,
slowly, distinctly, and severely:</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will be heard when I direct you to be heard. And
I now direct that your evidence shall be taken after the rest
of the witnesses for the prosecution have been examined,
cross-examined, and re-examined.”</p>

<p class='c008'>During this long altercation Jean Bower, standing in the
witness-box, is growing paler and paler. She clutches convulsively
the ledge before her, and Sir Harold looks at her
with concern. He does not wish her to faint before she has
answered his questions; on the other hand he tells himself
that the sight of a fainting young woman always touches
your more sentimental juryman.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great advocate happens to be, however, a far more
imaginative man than is Sir Almeric Post, and he realizes
that Jean Bower’s ordeal has lasted long enough. So, to
the disappointment of the Court, he does not address many
questions to the young woman who has just acknowledged
her passionate love for Harry Garlett, and for the sake of
whose love the immense majority—almost every human being
present at the trial—believe he has committed a singularly
foul and dastardly murder.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Almeric does not trouble to re-examine the witness.
He knows by now that he has practically won his case, and
he has no wish to cause any of the hapless human beings
connected with this painful story any unnecessary distress.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>IV</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Till comparatively lately a British prisoner could not give
evidence in his own defence, but that is no longer so, and
Henry Garlett is, as is known, eager to go into the witness-box.</p>

<p class='c008'>At once, when he is facing the Court with a strained tense
look, it becomes clear that Sir Almeric does not intend to
play with the wretched man as a cat plays with a mouse.
He leaves those methods to Sir Harold Anstey. To the
deep disappointment of many of those present, after Harry
Garlett has been sworn, only a comparatively short interchange
of question and answer takes place between the man
now on trial for his life and the man who leads the prosecution
against him:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understand that your only answer to the terrible charge
of which you stand accused is that you are absolutely and
entirely innocent?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is my answer,” says Henry Garlett in a firm voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I will just take you briefly through the principal
points. You lived, I understand, for thirteen years with
this poor lady whom you married when you were only
twenty-two and she twenty-seven—you being a penniless lad,
and she a considerable heiress?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is so,” says the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Though you claim to have been attached to your wife,
you were constantly away from home—in fact we have it
on record that out of the three hundred sixty-five days of
one year you were away one hundred forty-four days.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think that is very possible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If necessary I can prove it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I accept your statement.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Jean Bower became secretary to the Etna China
Company on April 23rd. I understand that you claim to
have been scarcely aware of the fact that a charming young
woman had entered your employment in the capacity of
official secretary to the limited company of which you were
managing director?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I was aware that Miss Jean Bower had become
secretary to my company. But, as you yourself have just
pointed out, I was away a great deal. Until we walked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>home together the day before my wife’s death, I had hardly
done more than exchange a few words with Miss Bower.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And yet, during the month before your wife’s death—a
month which, curiously enough, coincided with the stay
of Miss Bower at the Etna China factory—you were far
more often at your china factory than had been the case for
some time before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I deny that!” exclaims Henry Garlett. “Or if it happens
to be technically true, it was only because I was just
then preparing for the Australian cricket match.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now, Mr. Garlett, are you prepared to swear that
you did not go the Thatched Cottage as a result of the note
sent you by Miss Prince?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I swear that the only time I was in the Thatched Cottage
for full two years was the day I went down to show a cut
finger to Miss Prince.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you remember the circumstances of your visit to
her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, very well. It was the first time I had ever been in
her medicine room, though I had heard of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you recall any conversation you had with her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” replies Harry Garlett firmly. “I recall our conversation
quite clearly. What is more, I do not mind telling
you frankly that Miss Prince did mention the fact that she
possessed in her medicine cupboard three poisons—arsenic,
morphia, and opium.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a stir through the Court, and for a moment Sir
Almeric is taken aback.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you now admit that you were aware of the existence
of arsenic in the Thatched Cottage?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have never denied it——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t quibble, Garlett. Is there anything further you
would like to say about this point?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I would like to say that I remember advising Miss
Prince to hand over the three drugs in question to Dr. Maclean.
But I should like to add, though no doubt you will not
believe me——”</p>

<p class='c008'>The judge intervened sternly: “You have no right to
suggest such a thing to counsel for the Crown.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I beg your pardon. I should not have said that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it you wish to add?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>“Simply that the fact of the conversation that day had
actually slipped my memory till my solicitor, about a fortnight
ago, told me of Miss Prince’s admission as to her
possession of arsenic.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Almeric moves some of the papers he is holding in one
of his hands to the other hand, and then he asks in almost a
casual tone:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose I may take it that you were exceedingly surprised
when you learned that your wife had died from the
administration of an enormous dose of arsenic?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The prisoner stares at him. Then he answers quickly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was more than surprised, I was astounded.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At that Sir Almeric Post straightens himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And yet you ask the jury to believe that while the whole
village was ringing with the question as to where the poison
administered to Mrs. Garlett could have come from, you had
forgotten the all-important fact that there was a large supply
of arsenic within a few yards of your front door?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Henry Garlett looks manifestly troubled. For a few
moments he loses that air of calm, quiet, rigid self-control.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I admit it is very strange,” he says at last, in a hesitating
voice, “but you must remember two things. First, that I
was unaware of the importance attached to the question of
how the arsenic had reached my house. Secondly, that
I had always known in a vague way that Miss Prince had in
her possession many dangerous drugs which, as a rule, can
only be procured from a chemist. I mean by that, I was not
specially surprised at her admission that she had a number
of poisons in her medicine cupboard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He has spoken slowly, rather picking his words, and the
admission—if admission it can be called—makes a bad impression
on the Court. The audience in the galleries all
feel that they would have certainly remembered such a
startling fact as that a large amount of poison was in the
possession of a maiden lady living in such a quiet place as
Terriford seems to have been.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other questions are put to the prisoner. After all, Sir
Almeric Post is expected to work for his bread, and it would
never do were he to conduct the examination of a man accused
of murder in too rapid or perfunctory a manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>Garlett is shown the letter which was written to him by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>Jean Bower, and which was the immediate cause of his return
home earlier than he was expected. He is taken step
by step through the various stages of his growing friendship
with her, and pressed again and again as to the degree of his
knowledge of her before his wife’s death.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when the counsel for the Prosecution has done, there
is a general impression that the witness has been let off very
lightly. It is clear that Sir Almeric regards the prisoner as
already under sentence of death.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then comes the turn of Sir Harold Anstey. Sir Harold
goes on quite another tack to what he has done up to now.
His object is to show what a good, genial, delightful fellow
Harry Garlett has always proved himself to be.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though in his heart of hearts he considers cricket to be
an idiotic pastime, and though he has on occasion quoted
with approval Kipling’s famous line about “the flannelled
fools at the wicket,” he has made a special study of cricket
in the last week, and he now shows that knowledge to the
admiration of the Court, and especially to the admiration of
those present—they are a large number—who make a fetish
of the national game. He shows that his client is not only a
famous cricketer but also a remarkably modest cricketer—and
not till he has made that fact quite clear does he begin
on the real subject in hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>The judge has hardly listened while all this is going on.
In fact he has been leaning back, for the first time, a slight
ironic smile on his face. But after all, this is a <i><span lang="fr">cause célèbre</span></i>.
Sir Harold Anstey is a popular figure, and must be allowed
a fair run for his money. The judge reflects that fortunately
for Sir Harold the money will be forthcoming this time, for,
unlike the majority of murderers, Henry Garlett is a man of
substance.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last, however, Sir Harold gets down to real business.
In an almost cooing voice he asks his client something as
to his happy married life. But there he is not quite as successful
as he had hoped to be, or Harry Garlett is curiously
unwilling to make any play with that side of his past. He
answers yes or no to the probing questions, though at one
moment he is obviously so painfully moved that some few
people began to believe that perhaps he did really care for
his first wife.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>However, Sir Harold, who is nothing if not tactful when
dealing with a difficult witness, now turns to the question
of the Etna China works. He draws from his client an account
of all that has been done in the last ten years, and
especially since the war, for the benefit of the workers. He
makes it clear what a happy family they all were, and then,
with light, skilful touches, he brings out how important was
Miss Bower’s share in promoting harmony and comfort at
the factory. He is even successful in making the Court
realize something of what a very charming, old-fashioned
girl she seems to have been.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Almeric, who is very tired by now, and who knows
that to-morrow he will have to make a long, clear speech
to the stolid jury, does not re-examine, and when, after two
hours in the witness-box, Harry Garlett goes back to the
dock, he is mercifully quite unaware that, had there been
the slightest doubt in anybody’s mind as to his guilt, he
might have been kept in that box for four or five hours.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>V</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>And now opens the second day of the trial of Henry
Garlett on the charge of having murdered his wife. The
crowds round the doors of the Assize Court are almost as
large as ever, and yet there is not the same feeling of excitement
that there was on the first day.</p>

<p class='c008'>For one thing, all the most important witnesses have
already been in the box. For another, the trial, though the
verdict is regarded as a foregone conclusion, is not expected
to conclude till to-morrow. A good many unimportant
witnesses have still to be examined, among them a number
of well-known men, each of whom, when the issue of the
trial appeared far more uncertain than it does now, had expressed
themselves willing to tender evidence as to “character.”
These gentlemen will testify that is, that they have
always regarded Henry Garlett as a high-minded man, the
best of good fellows, and so on.</p>

<p class='c008'>After all these minor witnesses have been called, examined,
cross-examined, and re-examined, then Sir Almeric Post will
begin his address to the jurymen. Though it is known that
Sir Almeric never cuts a speech short, it is thought he will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>finish in time to allow Sir Harold to make a start to-day.
Sir Harold’s speeches to a jury are a delight to listen to,
but there seems some doubt as to whether the famous advocate,
who is known not to like interrupting a great oration in
the middle, may not so manoeuvre matters, with the kindly
connivance of his brother in the law, Sir Almeric, as to put
off the beginning of his speech till to-morrow morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yes, to-morrow is likely to be a very exciting day! There
will be Sir Harold’s pathetic powerful plea for the murderer;
the clear summing-up by the judge, who, although an old
man, has his wits keenly about him; and then the jury’s
retirement, maybe for quite a short time, maybe for a long
time—one can never tell which, even when the verdict is a
foregone conclusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>However, as was said a great, great many times—perhaps
a million times by various men and women all over the
kingdom that same evening and the next morning—it is
the unexpected in life that very often happens, and makes
the best-laid plans go wrong.</p>

<p class='c008'>Behold the Court assembled, the galleries full to bursting,
but the ladies in the reserved seats are not all of them quite
so distinguished-looking as those who graced the first day
of the trial. On the other hand, two noted novelists—one
a man the other a woman—have come down from London
to be present at the closing scenes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The judge has just taken his seat, but the prisoner has not
yet been brought up from below into the dock, when Sir
Harold Anstey rises and asks to be heard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have received, my lord, a very important communication,”
he says, in a tone of such marked gravity that every
one stiffens into attention.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then—was it by some mistake, or in the natural
course of events?—the prisoner is brought up between two
warders to take his usual place.</p>

<p class='c008'>He looks tired, dispirited, and for the first time his eyes
seem to seek out hungrily, thirstily, the figure of Jean Bower,
sitting below him on the witnesses’ bench. As if drawn by
some magnetic influence, she turns her head round at last,
and they exchange a long, piteous look.</p>

<p class='c008'>In answer to Sir Harold, the judge observes in a slow, unimpassioned
tone:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>“I, too, have received what is no doubt a copy of what
you term an important communication, Sir Harold. I am
exceedingly surprised that the parties in question should have
waited till this morning—in fact, till just half an hour ago—to
put this communication before me. I have already taken
certain steps, and I have no doubt you have done the same,
to test, shall we say, the value? of this communication. I
understand that both the solicitors for the Crown and Mr.
Toogood, the prisoner’s solicitor, are even now in telephonic
communication with London.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The judge’s words are listened to in absolute silence, and
no one can make head or tail of what they mean. But it is
plain that both Mr. Justice Freshwater and those two great
protagonists, Sir Almeric Post and Sir Harold Anstey, are
very much disturbed.</p>

<p class='c008'>All kinds of wild rumours are current, but the low murmur
of conversation is stilled by the loud voices of the
ushers ordering “Silence, silence in Court!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Every ear is strained to miss not a word as Sir Almeric
takes up the ball in this mysterious legal game. He says in
a very low voice:</p>

<p class='c008'>“In all the circumstances, my lord, I have arranged with
Sir Harold Anstey that he shall call Mrs. Cheale, formerly
Lucy Warren, as his witness, not mine. He proposes, with
your leave, to put her at once into the box.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A feeling of intense relief sweeps through the Court.
Then everything is going on according to plan? True, those
with sharper ears than the others had caught the name of
Mrs. Cheale. But most of the eager listeners suppose that
it is Miss Agatha Cheale who is going to be re-examined.
Into just a few minds there darts a sudden, lightning suspicion.
Agatha Cheale had always been something of a dark
horse; has she any revelation to make which she studiously
concealed while in the witness-box yesterday?</p>

<p class='c008'>Here and there some expert in criminology asked himself
or herself whether, after all, Agatha Cheale was not in some
way “in it,” an accomplice, maybe, of Henry Garlett?</p>

<p class='c008'>But curiosity will have to wait; for all at once, and
strange to say without her name being called out in the
usual way, a tall young woman is seen almost running up the
steps of the witness-box.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>She wears what, to the expert feminine eyes now insistently
fastened on her, are obviously cheap, ready-made,
badly cut mourning clothes; a rusty black serge coat and
skirt, and a curious-looking little black bonnet of the kind
which some of the older people in Court can remember having
been worn when they were young—a princess bonnet it
used to be called. This particular princess bonnet has a
queer wispy veil hanging down behind. In fact the young
woman—she is not only a young but a very good-looking
woman, so all the men in Court notice—looks like a widow
of the humblest working class.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of being ordered to stand down, in order that
Agatha Cheale may be called, to the general surprise the
stranger is sworn.</p>

<p class='c008'>With this witness the taking of the oath is not a perfunctory
formality, as it seemed to be with so many of the
witnesses, but a very solemn act. And, while she is being
sworn, she looks at the judge as if he were the only person
in that crowded Court.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Harold rises to his feet, and then the witness suddenly
cries out: “May I speak now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The judge leans forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, madam, you may not speak now. You are here to
answer questions put to you by counsel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She is obviously cowed by those quiet firm cold tones, and
clasps her hands nervously together on the ledge of the
witness-box as she stares distrustfully at the tall, stout
gentleman who is now going to put to her those questions to
which alone she may make answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your name,” begins Sir Harold in a very kindly, conversational
voice, “is Lucy Cheale?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Most of the general public in Court are surprised. What
an odd mistake for the great advocate to have made! But
of course he is tired—tired and worried no doubt by that
important communication concerning which he and the
judge have just had that curious little mysterious interchange
of words.</p>

<p class='c008'>He goes on quickly: “You were Lucy Warren?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Now he has corrected himself—so think all those who have
not noted that little word “were.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir, and I——”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>“Stop! Allow me to put my question—it will be far
quicker in the end. I mean by that, Mrs. Cheale——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hullo! <i>Mrs.</i> Cheale? What is happening to Sir Harold—the
quick, the bold, the resourceful, the man whose astonishing
memory is almost proverbial? Another thing happens
which is extraordinarily unusual with him—that is a piece
of paper is handed to him by his junior, and from it he
reads the following questions, and in each case without waiting
for an answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are the daughter of Mrs. Warren of the Thatched
Farm? Your age is now twenty-four? Till ten days ago
you were in the employment of Miss Prince at the Thatched
Cottage? Before that you were for a considerable time head
parlour-maid at the Thatched House?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He reads over these questions, or rather assertions, very
rapidly, and each time the woman witness nods her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now I ask you to recall what happened nine—or
was it ten—days ago?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Nine or ten days ago? Sir Harold surely means nine
months ago?</p>

<p class='c008'>Again the witness nods, this time eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You received the following telegram?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again Sir Harold turns round, and again a piece of paper
is handed up to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The witness holds out her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, the jury must hear the telegram, so I will read it
out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In clear tones Sir Harold, turning to face the jury, reads
out slowly the address, “Miss Lucy Warren, The Thatched
Cottage, Terriford.” Then he pauses dramatically, and
goes on:</p>

<p class='c010'>This conveys an offer of marriage from one who is your devout
lover. I am dying, and I want you. Lose not an hour. Come at
once to 106, Coburg Square, London.—<span class='sc'>Guy Cheale.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>Guy Cheale? Who on earth is he?</p>

<p class='c008'>There is great excitement in Court, and again the ushers
have to command “Silence!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Here is a rare slice of human nature with a vengeance!
Though what all this can have to do with Henry Garlett is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>a complete mystery. Many of the spectators in their eagerness
rise from their seats in order to get a better view of
the young woman who has inspired so strange, so pathetic,
so desperate an offer of marriage.</p>

<p class='c008'>One or two stupid people ask themselves whether, when a
witness has married in the interval between the commission
of a crime and the trial of the criminal, he or she has to explain
how and why the marriage came about.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Harold looks at his witness with his kindest, most
benignant expression, as he asks in a soft tone, and yet one
which is heard throughout all the Court:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I take it that you were deeply attached to this man Guy
Cheale—that you and he had some kind of an understanding?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her head drops, she whispers inaudibly: “Yes, I loved
him dearly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The great advocate repeats, for the benefit of those who
had not heard, the whispered words, “You loved him dearly.
And so, without even waiting to ask your mistress’s permission,
you left a note on the kitchen table, went to the
village post office and drew out some money from the Savings
Bank, and went straight off to London?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again there comes an almost inaudible “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now, Mrs. Cheale, we come to a very important
part of your evidence. You realize that you are on
oath?”</p>

<p class='c008'>This time she answers quite loud, “I do, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I pass over quickly the fact that within twenty-four
hours of your arrival you were married to this man, Guy
Cheale, on what was practically his death bed. But even
before the marriage he made to you a certain communication?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She bends her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now tell his lordship and the jury in your own words
what that communication was?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The witness straightens herself, and the judge, leaning
forward, looks at her keenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must ask you,” he says, but in no unkind tone, “to
speak up, madam. Otherwise the jury will not hear you.”
He might have added, “And I myself am a little hard of
hearing.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>The witness begins in a loud voice:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Cheale told me that before we were married he had
something to tell me about himself——”</p>

<p class='c008'>She stops short. Every one is staring at her. What is all
this about? Who is Mr. Cheale? By this time every one
in Court realizes that he must be related to Agatha Cheale,
as Cheale is such an odd name. Also, a good many people
know that Agatha Cheale has a brother. Is it conceivable
that he gave his sister away? Can it be that Agatha Cheale
committed the murder?</p>

<p class='c008'>Almost alone of all those present, the man in the dock
looks uninterested in what is going on. He has become so
tired, so utterly weary.</p>

<p class='c008'>But there is one person in Court—nobody is looking at
her—who is almost fainting with excitement and suspense.
That person is Jean Bower. Her head is thrown back. She
is gazing up into the troubled face of the woman who is in
the box just above her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He asked me,” goes on the witness, her voice gathering
strength, “if I would mind marrying a murderer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is an extraordinary stir, by far the greatest stir
there has yet been in that Court.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I answered him prompt—‘No, not if he was the murderer.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>One or two women giggle hysterically, and there comes a
stern “Silence!” from the judge himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He then went on to tell me that it was he who had
poisoned Mrs. Garlett.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A strange sound, a kind of strangled half-sigh, half-groan,
issues from the man in the dock. He slips down, and is seen
through the railings of the dock lying in a heap on the
floor.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the warders, after stooping down, stands up and
says stolidly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“The prisoner has fainted, my lord. Shall we take him
below?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and do not bring him back till I direct you to do so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But this occurrence, which would have made such an impression
at any other time, is scarcely noticed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Harold addresses the witness encouragingly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understand you to say that Guy Cheale, your late
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>husband, confessed to you before the marriage took place
that he had poisoned Mrs. Garlett. Did he tell you what
motive inspired him to commit this crime?”</p>

<p class='c008'>For the first time the witness falters. She turns to the
judge.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have I got to answer that, your worship?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The judge hesitates.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” he says at last. “I do not direct you to answer
that question.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Harold, now frowning a little, turns again to his witness,
“What happened after this conversation with Guy
Cheale?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I got him to let me send for the doctor, because I thought
he was going to die right then.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But to the best of your belief—this is a very important
point, Mrs. Cheale—he was absolutely in his right mind when
he made this strange communication to you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, absolutely in his right mind, sir. In fact, he
wanted me to have in somebody to take down the statement
he had just made to me. But I was frightened—I thought he
would be taken to prison. Cruel things are done, sir, sometimes,
to us poor folk, even when we’re dying.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Harold in a moved tone says:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I fear that is so, though I would fain hope not, Mrs.
Cheale.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He waits a moment. He is so obviously, so genuinely
moved, that every one in Court feels a sudden wave of liking
for him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well,” he says, recovering himself. “Now tell me
what happened next.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We was married then, sir. He’d fixed it all up before
I came.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her face suddenly relaxes; it becomes almost cheerful as
she adds:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course he’d known all along that nothing he’d done
would make any difference to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Harold goes on in a matter-of-fact tone:</p>

<p class='c008'>“The moment the marriage had been solemnized, he insisted,
I understand, on your sending for what I may call an
unofficial witness?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir. The minute the clergyman and all that was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>gone, he made me call the landlady of the place where he
was living—Mrs. Lightfoot’s her name. She had got quite
fond of him before I came. She was the marriage witness—leastways
one of them. He says to her: ‘Mrs. Lightfoot,
I’ve something to tell you. It’s very grave—you’ve got to
remember it. Maybe you’ll be sworn and asked about it.’
Then he told her what he had told me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mean he repeated to her the statement that he had
poisoned Mrs. Emily Garlett?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The witness again became almost inaudible, but it was
evident that she had answered, “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understand, Mrs. Cheale, that it was not till the day
before his death that he succeeded in persuading you to send
for a commissioner for oaths?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She answers in a low, halting voice:</p>

<p class='c008'>“When the doctor told me he couldn’t last out the night,
I didn’t think it mattered what happened. Besides, I knew
they couldn’t do much till the next day, and I believed that
the next day he would be dead—and so he was.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The commissioner for oaths,” Sir Harold looked at one
of the papers in his hand, “is Mr. Theophilus Jones——”</p>

<p class='c008'>There runs a nervous laugh through the Court. The judge
looks very stern.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Harold goes on—“of 15, London Wall. That gentleman,
or so I understand, has influenza. That is why he is
not here to-day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The witness answers, “Yes, sir—I’m afraid he caught cold
coming out to see my husband at night time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is another titter, which is quickly suppressed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You see, sir, I didn’t know what to do! And then Mrs.
Lightfoot, she says to me, ‘There’s a gentleman as is a commissioner
for oaths living in this very square. It was him
as had to do with the lease of this house.’ So I went round
to his home, sir, and I just told him the truth—that my
dear husband was dying and wanted to make a confession
to him. He’s an old gentleman, and he was very kind to
me. He said it wasn’t in order, but that he’d come. And
he did, sir. My husband had made me put down—he was
too weak to write himself—what he wanted said, and the
old gentleman, Mr. Jones, he read it over to him, and then
my husband swore it was all true.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>At this point Mr. Toogood is seen entering the Court, and
a memorandum is handed up to the judge.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meanwhile the witness remains standing quite still in
the box staring before her as if hardly knowing where she
is.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Harold reads a note from the judge, and then he goes
on with his examination of the witness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your husband, I understand, died within five hours of
making this statement?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is so, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was early yesterday morning?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you started at once, Mrs. Cheale, for Grendon? I
understand you did this in obedience to a desire expressed
by him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir. He made a joke like; he says to me: ‘You
won’t have many opportunities of keeping your marriage
vow—to obey me, Lucy—but I do give you an opportunity
now. The minute the breath’s out of my body,’ he says,
‘you’re to go straight off with that paper of which you’ve
got a copy. You’re to go to the office of that—’” she
hesitates—“‘that rascally lawyer, Toogood,’ he called him,
but then, sir, he always said all lawyers were rascals,
and he often would have his joke. ‘There,’ he says, ‘you’re
to find Toogood, and you’re to put this before him. No good
telegraphing,’ he said, ‘to judge or counsel. Lawyers are
dull, hide-bound villains, they’d take no notice of a telegram,
they’d think it was a hoax.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>The audience in Court turned amused eyes on the gentlemen
who are hearing themselves so candidly described. But
if they expect to see any signs of self-conscious confusion,
they are disappointed. All the lawyers remain perfectly
calm, and the witness goes on:</p>

<p class='c008'>“He says to me, ‘Have you enough money for a motor,
Lucy? That would perhaps be quickest of all. Then, on
the other hand,’ he says, ‘you might be killed in the motor.
So best go by train,’ he said. So I did what he wished. The
moment he was dead I left him alone with that kind soul,
Mrs. Lightfoot, and I only stopped long enough on the way
to the station to get the black clothes I’m now wearing——”</p>

<p class='c008'>And now the judge leans forward.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>“I regret,” he said somewhat severely, “that this statement
of yours was not put in yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never had no chance, sir—your worship. I did try to
be heard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir Harold interposes:</p>

<p class='c008'>“May I ask your lordship to allow me to read the sworn
statement made by Guy Cheale?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Sir Almeric jumps up. He looks ruffled and disturbed,
as he intimates:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not oppose my learned friend’s application, my
lord.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The next thing to do is to release the witness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That will do, Mrs. Cheale,” says Sir Harold in a courteous
tone. “We thank you very much for the clear way in
which you have given your evidence. I understand that
you wish to go back to London as soon as possible. If so,
I hope you will use my motor car.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A murmur of admiration for Sir Harold’s thoughtful
kindness runs through the Court. But to the judge Sir
Harold’s public announcement of his kindness seems highly
irregular, and his lordship hastens to create a diversion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sir Almeric Post,” he observes in his frigid tones, “in
view of what is contained in that sworn statement, it is for
you to read it to the jury, and not Sir Harold Anstey.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very good, my lord,” says Sir Almeric, and then, in his
passionless, clear tones he reads out the following words:</p>

<p class='c008'><i>“I, Guy Cheale, in full possession of all my faculties
though a dying man, wish to put it on record that I administered
the arsenic to Mrs. Emily Garlett for reasons best
known to myself, and which from my point of view were
sufficiently good and conclusive at the time, though I do not
expect any one else in the present state of our peculiar, complex
civilization, built as it is on a pyramid of lies, to agree
with me.</i></p>

<p class='c008'><i>“My sister, Agatha Cheale, then lady housekeeper at the
Thatched House, asked me three days before Mrs. Emily
Garlett’s death to take a note for her to Miss Prince’s house,
the Thatched Cottage. She informed me I could get straight
into the house through a garden door.</i></p>

<p class='c008'><i>“I followed her directions and found myself in the empty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>house. I laid the letter on the hall table. I then bethought
myself that I would go upstairs, as I’d heard Miss Prince
had a curious collection of medicaments, and I have always
been much interested in drugs.</i></p>

<p class='c008'><i>“I found the room in which they were kept with no difficulty.
The cupboard door was open, and I noticed the
stoppered bottle of arsenic. I took out about an ounce of
the white powder and put it in an envelope which I had in
my pocket. I then walked back to the Thatched Farm.
There I transferred the arsenic to a large empty pill-box.
To the best of my belief the pill-box, with some of the arsenic
still in it, will be found behind the fourth row of books in
the small glazed bookcase in the parlour there.</i></p>

<p class='c008'><i>“I ought here to add that when in the medicine room of
Miss Prince’s house I turned up the entry ‘Arsenic’ in a
medical work on her table. I thus discovered the right dose
for an adult. On the afternoon which preceded Mrs. Garlett’s
death I was one of two or three people who went and
sat with her for a time. In a sense I may say I acted on a
sudden impulse, for when I saw the small plateful of strawberries
outside her door with the sugar sifter close to it I
thought it an ideal opportunity for the accomplishment of
my purpose.</i></p>

<p class='c008'><i>“I asked her whether she would care to have the strawberries,
and she said yes, that she had not known there were
strawberries there. I went out of the room and mixed the
arsenic with the sugar, then I brought the plate into her
room. After she had eaten the strawberries I bade her
good-bye and removed the plate—she thought outside the
door—as a matter of fact I took it away with me, and threw
it under a bush in the little wood, where it doubtless still is.</i></p>

<p class='c008'><i>“I left the house as far as I know without having been
seen, though Lucy Warren had admitted me, and we had had
a short talk. Lucy was on the point of leaving the house
owing to our having been found together—I may add not in
any compromising sense—in the drawing room the night before
by my sister and Mrs. Garlett. Mrs. Garlett, of course,
had not recognized me. My sister, who is a generous woman,
handed over to me practically the whole of her legacy—her
unexpected legacy of a thousand pounds, which Mrs. Garlett
left her in her will.”</i></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>Suddenly there breaks across the level, passionless tones
of Sir Almeric’s voice a loud groan, and for the second time
that day a man faints in Court. He is hastily taken below,
but not before the Grendon folk present recognize him as
Enoch Bent, Lucy Cheale’s uncle and Mr. Toogood’s highly
respected head clerk. Few, however, of those who recognize
him ask themselves why Guy Cheale’s reference in his
statement to Mrs. Garlett’s will and the legacy to Guy
Cheale’s sister should have had such an effect on the worthy
Bent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fortunately for Bent, there is no need for him to be put
in the witness-box, there to have drawn from him, by the
persuasive arts of Sir Harold Anstey, an account—nay, a
confession—of certain highly reprehensible and most unprofessional
confidences concerning Mrs. Garlett’s will, made
before that lady’s tragic death. That other and greater confession—the
confession of Guy Cheale on his death-bed—has
shed an amply sufficient light on the Terriford Mystery.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the slight interruption caused by Bent’s collapse
and removal, Sir Almeric goes on reading Guy Cheale’s
statement from the exact place where he broke off:</p>

<p class='c008'><i>“With this money I went abroad, and I was still abroad
when the exhumation of Mrs. Garlett took place, and when
Mr. Garlett was committed for trial. While abroad—in
Spain, as a matter of fact—I became exceedingly ill. I
therefore made for home. My sister unwillingly consented
to hire a room in the house in which she was then living,
namely the house in which I am now.</i></p>

<p class='c008'><i>“In a sense it has been a race between my life and that of
Henry Garlett. I hope—I try to persuade myself—that I
should, in any case, have made this confession even had I not
been a dying man. Had I done so I should of course have
put myself first out of the power of English law, which
would not have been difficult, as I have always been a rolling
stone, as the silly saying is.</i></p>

<p class='c008'><i>“I hope it will not be considered egotistic on my part to put
on record my high appreciation of my wife’s fine nature. She
is a thoroughly good woman, and I hope that in time she will
forgive me, and that some man—a thousand-fold better man
than I can claim to be—will make her yet a happy woman.”</i></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>And what is happening meantime in the cold, rather
dark cell, where so many unhappy prisoners have sat, waiting
to be taken upstairs to hear the verdict?</p>

<p class='c008'>By special leave of the judge, Jean Bower has been allowed
to go below and join her lover, who will not now be a
prisoner for long.</p>

<p class='c008'>Together again at last, Harry Garlett and Jean Bower are
sitting on a hard wooden bench, hand in hand. They are
not alone. Two warders are watching them with stolid faces,
and they are still feeling bewildered, oppressed, by this
wonderful thing that has happened to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harry Garlett is saying to himself, “Guy Cheale? <i>Guy
Cheale!</i> Why, Emily liked him—<i>she liked him</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The door opens. “Mr. Garlett,” says a kind voice—the
voice of the Governor of Grendon Gaol. “Will you and
Miss Bower come upstairs to hear the verdict?”</p>

<p class='c008'>They get up. Still hand in hand they mount the dark
stairs. Then the prisoner—he is still a prisoner—raises
Jean’s hand and kisses it.</p>

<p class='c008'>They emerge into the crowded Court, all eyes upon them,
and he goes on up into the dock for the last time, while she
walks round to the witness bench, where Dr. Maclean has
preceded her.</p>

<p class='c008'>The jury are all in their places. They have evidently had
no difficulty in arriving at their verdict.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the clerk of the Court calls out:</p>

<p class='c008'>“How say you, gentlemen—guilty or not guilty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The foreman of the jury, looking very pale, answers in a
firm voice:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not Guilty.”</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
